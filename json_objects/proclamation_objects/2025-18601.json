    "title": "Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers",
    "summary": "The document is a presidential proclamation restricting the entry of certain nonimmigrant workers, specifically targeting the H1B visa program. It highlights systemic abuse of the H1B program, where employers have used it to replace American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled foreign labor, particularly in STEM fields. The proclamation notes that the number of foreign STEM workers has doubled from 2000 to 2019, while overall STEM employment increased by only 44.5 percent. IT firms have significantly manipulated the H1B system, leading to job losses and wage suppression for American workers. The proclamation imposes a $100,000 payment requirement for H1B petitions to address these abuses and aims to protect American workers' wages and job opportunities. It also mandates rulemaking to revise prevailing wage levels and prioritize high-skilled, high-paid alien admissions. The restriction is set to expire after 12 months unless extended.",
