    "title": "Fourth Anniversary of the Attack at Abbey Gate, 2025",
    "summary": "The document is a presidential proclamation by Donald J. Trump, marking the fourth anniversary of the attack at Abbey Gate in Kabul, Afghanistan, on August 26, 2021. The proclamation commemorates the 13 U.S. service members who were killed in the ISIS-K terrorist attack, which occurred during the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. The text criticizes the Biden administration's handling of the withdrawal, describing it as reckless and leading to the release of thousands of terrorists from Bagram prison. The proclamation also highlights the consequences of the attack, including the abandonment of allies, loss of military equipment, and the squandering of American resources. Trump emphasizes his administration's commitment to pursuing justice for the families of the fallen and upholding American strength and sovereignty. The proclamation encourages all Americans to remember the heroism of the service members and the Gold Star families.",
