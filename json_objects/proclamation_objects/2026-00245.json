    "summary": "This proclamation, issued by the President of the United States, details modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) to implement various trade agreements. Key actions include extending duty-free access for specified quantities of Israeli agricultural products through December 31, 2026, under the United States-Israel Agreement on Trade in Agricultural Products. It also addresses technical corrections and modifications to the HTSUS related to the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement and the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement. Furthermore, the proclamation rectifies inadvertent omissions in previous modifications concerning the African Growth and Opportunity Act and updates cross-references in the HTSUS related to reciprocal tariffs and trade agreements with the European Union, timber, lumber, and vehicles. These changes are authorized under various trade acts and executive orders, aiming to maintain reciprocal trade concessions and implement agreed-upon tariff treatments.",
