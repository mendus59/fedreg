    "title": "Regulatory Relief for Certain Stationary Sources To Promote American Mineral Security",
    "summary": "Presidential Proclamation 10987 of October 24, 2025, grants a two-year exemption from new emissions control requirements under the EPA's \"Copper Rule\" for certain domestic primary copper smelters. This action aims to promote American mineral security by acknowledging that the required emissions-control technology is not yet commercially demonstrated or cost-effective. The proclamation highlights copper's critical role in national security and the economy, and emphasizes that imposing the new standards on the limited number of remaining domestic smelters could lead to closures, weakening the U.S. industrial base and increasing reliance on foreign processing. The exemption is deemed in the national security interest of the United States.",
