    "summary": "The proclamation titled \"Establishing Project Homecoming,\" issued by President Donald J. Trump on May 9, 2025, addresses the issue of illegal immigration in the United States. It describes a significant increase in illegal aliens entering the country, leading to crime, strain on public services, and a financial burden on taxpayers, with costs exceeding $150 billion in Fiscal Year 2023.\n\nTo combat this situation, Project Homecoming offers illegal aliens a choice: they can voluntarily depart the U.S. with government assistance or face legal consequences for remaining. The initiative includes creating streamlined processes for voluntary departures, offering financial incentives known as an \"exit bonus,\" and establishing a concierge service to facilitate travel arrangements.\n\nAdditionally, the proclamation outlines penalties for those who do not leave voluntarily, including removal, prosecution, and financial repercussions. It mandates an increase in enforcement operations by hiring additional personnel to ensure compliance with the initiative.\n\nOverall, the proclamation aims to reduce the presence of illegal aliens in the U.S., alleviate the fiscal burden on taxpayers, and restore national sovereignty through a structured and incentivized departure program.",
