    "title": "Adjusting Imports of Timber, Lumber, and Their Derivative Products Into the United States",
    "summary": "The document is a presidential proclamation adjusting imports of timber, lumber, and their derivative products into the United States. The Secretary of Commerce found that imports of wood products threaten national security by weakening the domestic industry, creating vulnerabilities, and increasing reliance on foreign imports. The proclamation imposes tariffs on various wood products, with rates ranging from 10% to 50%, to strengthen supply chains, bolster industrial resilience, and create jobs. The tariffs will take effect on October 14, 2025, with increases scheduled for January 1, 2026. The proclamation also directs negotiations with foreign trading partners to address the national security threat and establishes processes to monitor imports and adjust tariffs as necessary. The actions aim to reduce foreign dependence, encourage domestic investment, and ensure the United States can meet its national security needs.",
