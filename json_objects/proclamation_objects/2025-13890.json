    "title": "Regulatory Relief for Certain Stationary Sources To Promote American Chemical Manufacturing Security",
    "summary": "The document is a presidential proclamation issued on July 17, 2025, titled \"Regulatory Relief for Certain Stationary Sources To Promote American Chemical Manufacturing Security.\" It highlights the importance of the U.S. chemical manufacturing sector for critical industries like energy, national defense, agriculture, and healthcare. The proclamation addresses the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) final rule (HON Rule) published on May 16, 2024, which imposes new emissions-control requirements on certain chemical manufacturing facilities. The proclamation argues that the HON Rule imposes substantial burdens on chemical manufacturers, with many requirements relying on technologies that are not practically available or can be implemented safely. As a result, the proclamation exempts certain stationary sources from compliance with the HON Rule for a period of 2 years, citing national security interests and the lack of available technology to meet the rule's requirements.",
