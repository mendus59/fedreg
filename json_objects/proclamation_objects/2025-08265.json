    "summary": "The document is a proclamation by President Donald J. Trump declaring May 4 through May 10, 2025, as National Small Business Week. It emphasizes the crucial role of small businesses in the U.S. economy, noting that they employ nearly half of the private-sector workforce and create a significant portion of new jobs. The proclamation acknowledges the challenges small business owners have faced, including high inflation and burdensome regulations, while highlighting the administration's efforts to support them through targeted tariffs, regulatory cuts, and initiatives aimed at promoting American manufacturing.\n\nKey findings include the recognition of the resilience and creativity of entrepreneurs, the commitment to fostering a pro-growth environment, and the importance of small businesses in driving innovation and economic growth. The implications suggest a renewed focus on empowering small businesses, which are seen as essential to strengthening American families and leading the nation towards economic prosperity. The proclamation calls on all Americans to acknowledge and support the contributions of small business owners.",
