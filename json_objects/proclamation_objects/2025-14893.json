    "title": "Adjusting Imports of Copper Into the United States",
    "summary": "The document is a presidential proclamation adjusting imports of copper into the United States, effective August 1, 2025. It imposes a 50% tariff on semifinished copper products and intensive copper derivatives, citing national security threats due to excessive reliance on foreign imports. The proclamation aims to boost domestic copper production, reduce foreign dependency, and strengthen national security by ensuring a stable supply of copper for defense and critical infrastructure. Key findings include the essential role of copper in manufacturing and national security, the decline of U.S. copper production, and the need for corrective action to address unfair trade practices. The proclamation also outlines a process for monitoring and potentially adjusting tariffs based on future market conditions.",
