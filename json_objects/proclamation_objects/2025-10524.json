    "summary": "The document titled \"Proclamation 10947 of June 3, 2025\" outlines the President's decision to adjust tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum into the United States. Following investigations by the Secretary of Commerce, it was determined that these imports pose a threat to national security. As a result, the tariffs on steel and aluminum articles, along with their derivatives, have been increased from 25 percent to 50 percent ad valorem, effective June 4, 2025.\n\nKey findings from the proclamation include:\n\n1. **National Security Concerns**: The Secretary of Commerce reported that both steel and aluminum imports threaten to impair U.S. national security, prompting the need for tariff adjustments.\n   \n2. **Previous Tariff Actions**: Previous proclamations had already established tariffs; however, the current adjustments aim to provide stronger support for U.S. industries and counteract foreign competition.\n\n3. **Monitoring and Compliance**: The Secretary is tasked with ongoing monitoring of imports and will inform the President of any developments that may necessitate further action.\n\n4. **UK Trade Considerations**: The proclamation allows for differentiated treatment of imports from the United Kingdom under the U.S.-UK Economic Prosperity Deal, maintaining a 25 percent tariff unless compliance issues arise.\n\n5. **Implementation Measures**: U.S. Customs and Border Protection will enforce strict compliance with declaration requirements for imported articles, including penalties for noncompliance.\n\nOverall, the proclamation emphasizes the administration's commitment to protecting U.S. industries and national security through increased tariffs on critical imports.",
