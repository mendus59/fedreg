It emphasizes the importance of protecting children, recognizing them as vital to families and the nation's future. The proclamation calls for a collective effort to prevent child abuse and neglect, highlighting the need for stable families and loving parents.\n\nThe President expresses concern over what he describes as the harmful effects of gender ideology on children, asserting that it leads to confusion and suffering. He mentions Executive Order 14187, which prohibits public schools from teaching transgender ideology and restricts funding to institutions involved in what he terms \"sexual mutilation\" of youth. \n\nThe proclamation urges all Americans to be vigilant about children's safety and to support their development. It concludes with a commitment to hold abusers accountable and to empower children to embrace their identity as intended. Overall, the document calls for a national effort to safeguard children from various forms of abuse, particularly those related to gender ideology.",
