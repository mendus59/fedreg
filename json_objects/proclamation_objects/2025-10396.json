    "summary": "The document titled \"2025-10396.pdf\" outlines a notice from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) regarding the renewal of an information collection titled \"Survey of OCC-Supervised Community Banks.\" This initiative aims to gather feedback from community banks to assess the effectiveness of OCC's support and supervisory efforts. The OCC is revising the survey to remove limitations on the subset of banks surveyed, allowing for more flexibility in selecting participants based on various operational factors.\n\nThe comment period for this information collection is open until August 8, 2025, and the OCC encourages submissions via email or other specified methods. The survey is designed to collect non-generalizable information on customer satisfaction, which will help the OCC enhance its supervisory, training, and outreach activities.\n\nKey figures include an estimated 827 respondents, with each expected to spend about 2 hours on the survey, resulting in a total annual burden of approximately 1,654 hours. The OCC seeks comments on the necessity and utility of the information collection, accuracy of burden estimates, and ways to improve the process. Overall, this initiative underscores the OCC's commitment to effectively supporting community banks and adapting its strategies based on their feedback.",
