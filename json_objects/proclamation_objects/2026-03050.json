    "title": "Ensuring Affordable Beef for the American Consumer",
    "summary": "Proclamation 11010, issued by the President on February 6, 2026, aims to ensure affordable beef for American consumers by temporarily increasing the quantity of in-quota imports of lean beef trimmings. This action is a response to a combination of factors that have led to record lows in the U.S. cattle herd and significantly higher beef prices. These factors include severe droughts and wildfires affecting cattle-producing states, and import restrictions on live animals from Mexico due to screwworm detections. The proclamation authorizes an increase of 80,000 metric tons for calendar year 2026, specifically for lean beef trimmings, allocated entirely to Argentina. This increase will be administered in four quarterly tranches, with the first opening on February 13, 2026. The Secretary of Agriculture is tasked with continuing to monitor domestic beef supply and advising the President on any further necessary actions.",
