    "title": "Adjusting Imports of Processed Critical Minerals and Their Derivative Products Into The United States",
    "summary": "A Presidential Proclamation from January 14, 2026, addresses the national security threat posed by imports of processed critical minerals and their derivative products (PCMDPs) into the United States. The Secretary of Commerce's report found that these imports threaten to impair U.S. national security due to over-reliance on foreign sources, lack of secure supply chains, price volatility, and weakened domestic production capacity. PCMDPs are deemed essential for national defense, critical infrastructure, and various industries, including electronics, energy, and communications. The proclamation directs the Secretary of Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative to negotiate agreements with foreign nations to secure adequate critical mineral supplies and mitigate supply chain vulnerabilities. If satisfactory agreements are not reached, further actions, such as import restrictions or minimum import prices, may be considered. The proclamation also mandates ongoing monitoring of PCMDP imports and a review of their national security implications.",
