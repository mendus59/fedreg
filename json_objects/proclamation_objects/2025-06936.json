    "title": "Regulatory Relief for Certain Stationary Sources To Promote American Energy",
    "summary": "The document titled \"Proclamation 10914 of April 8, 2025\" outlines a regulatory relief initiative by President Donald J. Trump aimed at coal-fired electricity generation in the United States. It emphasizes the importance of coal for maintaining a reliable and affordable electricity grid and national energy security. The proclamation addresses concerns regarding the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) final rule on emissions standards for coal and oil-fired power plants, which imposes stringent compliance requirements based on technologies that are not yet commercially viable.\n\nKey findings include:\n\n1. The new rule could lead to the shutdown of many coal-fired power plants, risking thousands of jobs and threatening the stability of the electrical grid.\n2. The proclamation grants a two-year exemption from compliance with the new rule for certain stationary sources, allowing them to adhere to previous standards until July 8, 2029.\n3. The decision is framed as necessary for national security, as it aims to prevent increased dependence on foreign energy sources and potential electricity shortages.\n\nOverall, the proclamation seeks to balance environmental regulations with the need for energy security and economic stability in the coal sector.",
