    "summary": "Proclamation 11003 of January 16, 2026, declares January 16, 2026, as Religious Freedom Day, celebrating 250 years of the United States as a republic founded on the principle of religious freedom. The proclamation traces this principle from the Mayflower's journey and the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom to the First Amendment. It highlights the current administration's efforts to bring faith back into the public square, including establishing the White House Faith Office, the Religious Liberty Commission, a Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias, and promoting prayer in public schools. The proclamation calls for Americans to commemorate the day by honoring religious freedom and gathering at places of worship.",
