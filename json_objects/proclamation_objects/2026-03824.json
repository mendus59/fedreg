    "title": "Imposing a Temporary Import Surcharge To Address Fundamental International Payments Problems",
    "summary": "Presidential Proclamation 11012, issued on February 20, 2026, imposes a temporary 10 percent import surcharge for 150 days to address fundamental international payments problems. The proclamation cites large and serious U.S. balance-of-payments deficits, including a significant goods trade deficit and a negative primary income balance, as the primary drivers for this action. The surcharge aims to correct these deficits and stabilize the U.S. economy and national interests. However, several categories of products are exempted from the surcharge, including critical minerals, energy products, certain agricultural goods, pharmaceuticals, vehicles, and goods from Canada, Mexico, and certain Central American countries under specific trade agreements. These exceptions are deemed necessary for the U.S. economy and consistent with the Trade Act of 1974.",
