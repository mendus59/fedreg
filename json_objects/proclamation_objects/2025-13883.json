    "summary": "The document is a presidential proclamation issued on July 17, 2025, by President Donald J. Trump, titled \"Regulatory Relief for Certain Stationary Sources To Further Promote American Energy.\" The proclamation addresses the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) final rule published on May 7, 2024, which amended the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for coal- and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units, making them more stringent. The proclamation argues that the rule places severe burdens on coal-fired power plants and threatens the viability of the nation's coal sector, as the required emissions-control technologies are not yet commercially available. To mitigate these risks, the proclamation exempts certain stationary sources from compliance with the rule for a period of 2 years beyond the rule's compliance date, extending from July 8, 2027, to July 8, 2029. The exemption is justified on the grounds that the technology to implement the rule is not available and that issuing the exemption is in the national security interests of the United States.",
