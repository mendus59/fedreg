    "summary": "In 2025, President Donald J. Trump proclaimed October as National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, emphasizing the importance of strengthening the nation's cybersecurity. The proclamation highlights recent cyber threats targeting American civilians and businesses, which have caused significant disruptions and financial damages. In response, the Administration signed an Executive Order to enhance cybersecurity measures, including secure software development, adoption of advanced encryption protocols, and refocusing AI efforts on vulnerability management. The First Lady's leadership in passing the TAKE IT DOWN Act was also noted for protecting children from online exploitation. The proclamation encourages all Americans to take steps to safeguard their personal devices and data, and it calls for national recognition and observance of cybersecurity awareness through events, training, and education to bolster the country's national security and resilience.",
