    "title": "Enhancing National Security by Addressing Risks at Harvard University",
    "summary": "The document is Proclamation 10948 issued by President Donald J. Trump on June 4, 2025, addressing national security concerns related to Harvard University. The proclamation asserts that admission to U.S. educational institutions is a privilege contingent on compliance with federal laws. It criticizes Harvard for allegedly failing to adequately report misconduct by foreign students, which poses risks to national security, particularly regarding foreign adversaries exploiting the student visa system.\n\nKey findings include:\n- Harvard's increasing crime rates and insufficient disciplinary actions against foreign students.\n- The university's refusal to provide requested information about foreign students' illegal activities, leading to a perceived lack of transparency and accountability.\n- Harvard's extensive financial connections with foreign governments, notably over $150 million from China, raising concerns about potential collaboration with adversarial entities.\n\nAs a consequence, the proclamation restricts the entry of foreign nationals seeking to study at Harvard or participate in exchange programs, effective for six months unless extended. It emphasizes the need for Harvard to comply with federal information requests to mitigate national security risks. The implications suggest a significant shift in U.S. policy towards foreign student admissions at institutions deemed non-compliant, potentially affecting Harvard's international student enrollment and broader educational practices in the U.S.",
