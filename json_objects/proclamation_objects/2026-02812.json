    "title": "Unleashing American Commercial Fishing in the Atlantic",
    "summary": "Proclamation 11009, issued by the President on February 6, 2026, revokes Proclamation 10287 and reinstates Proclamation 10049, thereby allowing commercial fishing within the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument. The proclamation asserts that existing federal laws, including the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Endangered Species Act, and others, adequately protect the monument's objects of historic and scientific interest. It argues that commercial fishing, when appropriately managed under these existing authorities, does not pose a risk to these protected interests. This decision reverses a previous prohibition on commercial fishing within the monument that was put in place by Proclamation 10287 in 2021.",
