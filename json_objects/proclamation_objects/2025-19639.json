    "title": "Adjusting Imports of Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles, Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicle Parts, and Buses Into the United States",
    "summary": "The document is a presidential proclamation issued on October 17, 2025, adjusting imports of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs), MHDV parts, and buses into the United States. The Secretary of Commerce reported that these imports threaten national security by impairing military readiness, emergency response capabilities, and critical infrastructure. The proclamation imposes a 25% tariff on MHDVs and key parts, and a 10% tariff on buses, aiming to stabilize the U.S. market share to approximately 80% for MHDVs. The measures are designed to strengthen supply chains, bolster industrial resilience, create jobs, and encourage domestic investment and innovation. The proclamation also establishes processes to monitor imports, adjust tariffs, and ensure compliance, with ongoing review and potential modifications based on national security assessments.",
