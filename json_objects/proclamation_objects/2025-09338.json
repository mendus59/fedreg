    "summary": "The document is a proclamation by President Donald J. Trump declaring May 2025 as Jewish American Heritage Month. It emphasizes the significant contributions of Jewish Americans throughout U.S. history, highlighting their roles in various fields and their pursuit of freedom to practice their faith without persecution. The proclamation reflects on the historical context of Jewish Americans, referencing George Washington's letter to the Hebrew Congregation of Newport, which advocated for safety and goodwill towards Jewish citizens.\n\nThe document addresses the troubling rise of anti-Semitism, particularly following the attacks on October 7, 2023, which marked a significant shift in the Jewish community's perception of safety in America. It condemns all forms of anti-Semitism, including those disguised as anti-Zionism, and reaffirms the administration's commitment to combating such hate.\n\nTrump calls for a celebration of Jewish heritage and contributions, urging Americans to engage in appropriate observances throughout the month. The proclamation underscores the administration's dedication to standing with Israel and protecting Jewish citizens, asserting that anti-Semitism has no place in the United States.",
