    "title": "Amendments to Adjusting Imports of Timber, Lumber, and Their Derivative Products Into the United States",
    "summary": "Proclamation 11000, issued on December 31, 2025, amends prior actions regarding the import of timber, lumber, and their derivative products into the United States. Following a finding that these imports threaten U.S. national security, initial tariffs were imposed in September 2025. This new proclamation delays the scheduled increase in duty rates for upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets, and vanities from January 1, 2026, to January 1, 2027. This delay is intended to facilitate ongoing negotiations with various countries to address the national security concerns. The U.S. Trade Representative is directed to continue these negotiations and provide updates, with a specific update due 180 days after the original proclamation. The existing tariffs will remain in place to continue adjusting imports and addressing the national security threat.",
