    "summary": "The document is a presidential proclamation (Proclamation 10976) issued on September 29, 2025, adjusting imports of timber, lumber, and their derivative products into the United States. The proclamation is based on a report by the Secretary of Commerce, which found that imports of wood products threaten national security by weakening the economy, causing mill closures, and disrupting supply chains. The proclamation imposes tariffs on various wood products, with rates ranging from 10% to 50%, and directs the Trade Representative to negotiate agreements with foreign trading partners to address the national security threat. The proclamation also establishes processes to monitor imports, add additional wood products to the tariffs, and address undervaluation. The tariffs are set to take effect on October 14, 2025, with some rates increasing on January 1, 2026. The proclamation aims to strengthen supply chains, bolster industrial resilience, create jobs, and increase domestic capacity utilization for wood products.",
