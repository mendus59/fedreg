The proclamation emphasizes that Black history is an integral part of American history, highlighting the timeless contributions of Black Americans to the nation's government, laws, military, economy, workforce, and culture. It asserts that the strength of the nation lies in a shared commitment to freedom, not differences, and criticizes attempts to divide citizens based on race.

It also mentions the planned National Garden of American Heroes honoring Black icons, an Executive Order to promote excellence at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and ongoing efforts to improve safety, affordability, and the American Dream for all.
