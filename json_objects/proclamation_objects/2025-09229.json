It honors law enforcement officers who protect communities and memorializes those who have lost their lives in the line of duty. The proclamation criticizes the previous administration's policies for fostering lawlessness and emphasizes the current administration's commitment to enhancing law enforcement capabilities, including a proposal for the death penalty for the murder of police officers and a crime bill to strengthen protections for them.\n\nThe President calls for national observance of this week, urging Americans to participate in ceremonies and requesting that flags be flown at half-staff. The proclamation reflects a strong support for law enforcement and a pledge to restore public safety and trust.",
