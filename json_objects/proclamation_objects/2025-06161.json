    "title": "National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, 2025",
    "summary": "The document is a proclamation by President Donald J. Trump declaring April 2025 as National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. It emphasizes the need to address sexual violence, attributing an increase in such crimes to illegal immigration and policies from the previous administration. The proclamation memorializes victims of violence, particularly highlighting the case of Jocelyn Nungaray, and notes the renaming of a wildlife refuge in her honor.\n\nThe President asserts that his administration is taking decisive actions to combat sexual violence and human trafficking, including declaring a national emergency at the southern border, designating cartels as terrorist organizations, and enacting the Laken Riley Act to detain illegal aliens with criminal convictions. He calls on all Americans to support survivors and work collectively to prevent sexual assault in their communities.\n\nThe key implications of this proclamation include a strong stance against illegal immigration as a contributing factor to crime, a commitment to enhancing border security, and a call for community involvement in addressing and preventing sexual violence.",
