    "summary": "The document is a proclamation by President Donald J. Trump declaring April 2025 as National Donate Life Month. It emphasizes the importance of organ donations, noting that over 170 million Americans are registered donors, and last year nearly 50,000 lives were saved through organ transplants. The proclamation highlights the critical need for donors, as more than 103,000 individuals are currently on the transplant waiting list, with 17 people dying each day while awaiting a transplant. \n\nThe President urges all eligible Americans to consider registering as organ donors, which can be done easily online or at local registries. The proclamation serves to honor both donors and recipients, encouraging discussions about organ donation among families and loved ones. The overarching message is one of compassion and the urgent need for more registered donors to save lives.",
