    "title": "Regulatory Relief for Certain Stationary Sources To Promote American Coke Oven Processing Security",
    "summary": "Presidential Proclamation 10993 grants a two-year exemption from certain requirements of the EPA's National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Coke Ovens (Coke Oven Rule) to specific stationary sources. This exemption is intended to promote American coke oven processing security by addressing the severe burdens the Coke Oven Rule places on the industry. The proclamation states that the necessary emissions-control technologies are not yet commercially demonstrated or cost-effective, and that the rule's compliance timeline risks facility closures, production halts, and harm to the domestic coke production industry, thereby undermining national security. The exemption allows these sources to continue operating under the emissions and compliance obligations that existed prior to the Coke Oven Rule for the duration of the two-year extension.",
