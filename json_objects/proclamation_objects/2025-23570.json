    "title": "Restricting and Limiting the Entry of Foreign Nationals To Protect the Security of the United States",
    "summary": "Proclamation 10998, issued by the President, restricts and limits the entry of foreign nationals to protect U.S. security. Citing deficiencies in screening and vetting processes in numerous countries, the proclamation expands upon previous executive orders and proclamations. Key findings include widespread corruption, poor record-keeping, and inadequate identity-management systems in many nations, which facilitate fraud and pose national security risks. The proclamation details specific countries subject to full or partial suspension of entry for immigrants and nonimmigrants, citing high visa overstay rates, terrorist activity, and refusal to accept the return of removable nationals as justifications. It also modifies previous exceptions, notably for immigrant visas for family members, to prevent exploitation. The proclamation emphasizes the need for foreign governments to improve their identity-management and information-sharing protocols to comply with U.S. requirements. It mandates a review of these restrictions every 180 days and outlines specific exceptions, including for lawful permanent residents and certain visa classifications. The proclamation takes effect on January 1, 2026.",
