Trump on November 7, 2025, grants a full, complete, and unconditional pardon to all United States citizens for conduct related to the 2020 Presidential Election. This includes actions concerning the advice, creation, organization, execution, submission, support, voting, participation in, or advocacy for any slate of Presidential electors, as well as efforts to expose voting fraud and vulnerabilities. The proclamation states that it aims to end a national injustice and continue national reconciliation. However, the pardon does not apply to President Donald J. Trump himself.
