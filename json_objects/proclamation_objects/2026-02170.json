    "summary": "Proclamation 11006 of January 28, 2026, declares National School Choice Week, January 25-31, 2026. The proclamation emphasizes parental rights in education and criticizes past federal education policies for low scores and high spending. Key initiatives highlighted include the \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" which establishes a nationwide tax credit for educational expenses and creates \"Trump Accounts\" for K-12 education savings. An executive order directs the Department of Education to support K-12 scholarship programs and explore the closure of the department to shift policy control to states. The administration is also moving away from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, focusing on merit and eliminating federal funding for schools with discriminatory or anti-American practices. The proclamation commends states with universal school choice programs and expresses a commitment to expanding school choice nationwide.",
