    "summary": "Proclamation 10988 of November 7, 2025, declares the week of November 2 through November 8, 2025, as Anti-Communism Week. The proclamation commemorates the devastation caused by communism, citing over 100 million lives lost and the suppression of faith, freedom, and prosperity. It emphasizes the enduring strength of liberty and human worth, rejecting ideologies that demand submission to state power. The document highlights that even after the Cold War, new forms of tyranny persist, cloaked in social justice or democratic socialism, but America remains founded on the principle that liberty and opportunity are birthrights. The week serves to honor victims of oppression and affirm that systems denying fundamental rights will be relegated to history.",
