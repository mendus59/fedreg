    "title": "Regulatory Relief for Certain Stationary Sources To Promote American Iron Ore Processing Security",
    "summary": "The document is a presidential proclamation issued on July 17, 2025, titled \"Regulatory Relief for Certain Stationary Sources To Promote American Iron Ore Processing Security.\" It highlights the importance of taconite iron ore processing for U.S. steel production, national defense, and critical infrastructure. The proclamation addresses the Environmental Protection Agency's final rule (Taconite Rule) published on March 6, 2024, which imposes new emissions-control requirements on taconite processing facilities. The proclamation exempts certain stationary sources from compliance with the Taconite Rule for a period of 2 years beyond the relevant compliance dates, citing the unavailability of required technologies and the need to protect national security and economic resilience. The exemption aims to prevent shutdowns, reduce domestic production, and ensure the continued supply of steel for defense, energy, and critical manufacturing.",
