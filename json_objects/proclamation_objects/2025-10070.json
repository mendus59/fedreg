    "summary": "The document is a proclamation by President Donald J. Trump commemorating the 101st Anniversary of the United States Border Patrol (USBP) on May 28, 2025. It honors the bravery and dedication of USBP agents in safeguarding the nation against threats such as drugs, weapons, and criminal activities. The proclamation criticizes the previous administration for allegedly allowing an influx of unvetted illegal aliens, which adversely affected the USBP's morale and resources.\n\nTrump outlines the measures taken during his presidency to address border security, including declaring a National Emergency, designating certain cartels as terrorist organizations, resuming border wall construction, and implementing strict immigration policies, which led to a significant decrease in border encounters and drug trafficking. He emphasizes the importance of supporting USBP agents and remembers those who have lost their lives in service.\n\nThe proclamation serves to reaffirm the commitment to border security and to empower the USBP in its mission to protect the homeland.",
