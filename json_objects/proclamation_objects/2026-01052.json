    "title": "Adjusting Imports of Semiconductors, Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment, and Their Derivative Products Into the United States",
    "summary": "A Presidential Proclamation issued on January 14, 2026, details findings that imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products threaten U.S. national security. The Secretary of Commerce's report indicated insufficient domestic production capacity to meet demand, leading to over-reliance on foreign supply chains. Semiconductors are deemed essential for economic, industrial, and military strength, as well as for all 16 critical infrastructure sectors. The proclamation outlines a two-phase plan: first, ongoing trade negotiations and an immediate 25% ad valorem tariff on a narrow category of advanced computing chips (with exceptions for those supporting U.S. supply chain buildout), and second, broader tariffs after negotiations conclude, potentially with a tariff offset program. The proclamation directs the Secretary and the U.S. Trade Representative to pursue negotiations and imposes the 25% tariff effective January 15, 2026, on specific \"Covered Products\" unless they contribute to strengthening the U.S. technology supply chain or domestic manufacturing capacity. Exemptions include use in U.S. data centers (defined by high AI load), repairs, R&D, startups, consumer electronics, industrial applications, and public sector use. The Secretary will continue to monitor imports and report on any circumstances indicating a need for further action.",
