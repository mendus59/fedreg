    "title": "Regulatory Relief for Certain Stationary Sources To Promote American Security With Respect to Sterile Medical Equipment",
    "summary": "The document is a presidential proclamation issued on July 17, 2025, titled \"Regulatory Relief for Certain Stationary Sources To Promote American Security With Respect to Sterile Medical Equipment.\" It highlights the critical role of ethylene oxide in sterilizing medical equipment and the severe burdens imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency's final rule (EtO Rule) published on April 5, 2024. The proclamation exempts certain stationary sources from compliance with the EtO Rule for a period of 2 years, citing the lack of commercially viable technology to meet the new emissions standards and the national security implications of disrupting the supply of sterile medical equipment. The exemption aims to prevent the closure of sterilization facilities and ensure the continued availability of critical medical devices for both civilian and military medical systems. The proclamation is signed by President Donald J. Trump and includes specific determinations supporting the exemption.",
