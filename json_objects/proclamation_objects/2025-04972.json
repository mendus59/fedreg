The proclamation addresses the urgent issue of overdose deaths from accidental poisoning, particularly emphasizing the rising threat of fentanyl, which has become the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45.\n\nThe President outlines actions taken by his administration to combat this crisis, including designating drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, imposing tariffs on countries contributing to the fentanyl crisis, and enhancing border protection efforts. He highlights significant seizures of fentanyl in the first month of his administration and stresses the importance of protecting families from the dangers of poisoning, including household chemicals and medications.\n\nThe proclamation encourages all Americans to educate themselves about poisoning risks and utilize resources like the Poison Help Line. The overarching message is a call to action for the public to take preventative measures against accidental poisonings and to raise awareness about these dangers. The proclamation reflects a commitment to safeguarding American families and addressing the opioid crisis.",
