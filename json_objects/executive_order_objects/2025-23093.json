    "title": "Protecting American Investors From Foreign-Owned and Politically-Motivated Proxy Advisors",
    "summary": "Executive Order 14366, issued by the President on December 11, 2025, aims to protect American investors by increasing oversight of foreign-owned proxy advisors, Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. and Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC. These firms, which dominate the market, influence corporate governance and investment decisions for millions of Americans through their recommendations on shareholder voting. The order expresses concern that these advisors may prioritize politically motivated agendas, such as diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies, over investor returns. Key directives include a review by the SEC Chairman of existing rules and guidance related to proxy advisors, with consideration for revisions or rescissions that conflict with the order's purpose, particularly concerning DEI and ESG. The SEC is also tasked with enforcing anti-fraud provisions, assessing registration requirements for proxy advisors, enhancing transparency on their recommendations and conflicts of interest, and examining whether their practices align with fiduciary duties. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chairman will review state antitrust investigations and investigate potential unfair methods of competition or deceptive practices by proxy advisors. The Secretary of Labor will revise regulations and guidance concerning the fiduciary status of individuals advising on ERISA plan investments, with a focus on strengthening fiduciary standards and transparency regarding proxy advisors' practices, especially concerning non-pecuniary factors like DEI and ESG.",
