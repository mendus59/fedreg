    "title": "Restoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal Censorship",
    "summary": "The document is Executive Order 14149, issued on January 20, 2025, aimed at restoring freedom of speech and ending federal censorship in the United States. It emphasizes the First Amendment's essential role in protecting citizens' rights to free speech without government interference. The order criticizes the previous administration for allegedly censoring speech under the pretext of addressing misinformation, thereby infringing on constitutional rights.\n\nKey policies outlined include securing the right to constitutionally protected speech, preventing federal agents from engaging in or facilitating censorship, and ensuring taxpayer resources are not used for such purposes. The Attorney General is tasked with investigating past federal censorship actions and reporting findings to the President, with recommendations for remedial actions.\n\nThe order also clarifies that it does not create enforceable rights against the government or its entities. The implications of this executive order suggest a significant shift towards prioritizing free speech and limiting government influence over public discourse.",
