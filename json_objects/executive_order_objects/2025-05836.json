    "title": "Exclusions From Federal Labor-Management Relations Programs",
    "summary": "The document is an Executive Order (14251) issued on March 27, 2025, which establishes exclusions from Federal Labor-Management Relations Programs to enhance U.S. national security. It identifies specific agencies and subdivisions engaged in intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work, determining that existing labor relations laws cannot be applied to them without compromising national security.\n\nKey provisions include:\n\n1. **Agency Exclusions**: The order lists numerous federal departments (e.g., State, Defense, Treasury, Veterans Affairs) and their subdivisions that are exempt from federal labor-management relations due to their national security functions.\n\n2. **Delegation of Authority**: It grants the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs the authority to suspend labor relations statutes for certain subdivisions, provided they certify that national security considerations are met.\n\n3. **Implementation Instructions**: Agencies must reassign employees previously covered by collective bargaining agreements to agency-specific duties and terminate ongoing grievance proceedings.\n\n4. **Reporting Requirement**: Agency heads must report any additional subdivisions that meet the criteria for exclusion within 30 days.\n\n5. **General Provisions**: The order clarifies that it does not grant any enforceable rights or benefits to individuals against the U.S. or its agencies.\n\nThe implications of this order are significant, as it narrows the scope of labor rights for employees in key national security roles, potentially impacting workforce dynamics and employee relations within those agencies.",
