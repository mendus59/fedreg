    "summary": "Executive Order 14376, titled \"Stopping Wall Street From Competing With Main Street Homebuyers,\" aims to address the increasing difficulty for American families, particularly first-time homebuyers, to purchase homes due to high inflation, interest rates, and competition from large Wall Street investors. The policy states that large institutional investors should not buy single-family homes that could otherwise be purchased by families. Key directives include: defining \"large institutional investor\" and \"single-family home\"; preventing federal agencies and government-sponsored enterprises from facilitating or disposing of single-family homes to large institutional investors while promoting sales to individual owner-occupants; reviewing and potentially revising rules related to large institutional investors acquiring or holding single-family homes; antitrust reviews of substantial acquisitions by large institutional investors for anti-competitive effects; requiring disclosure of ownership and control for single-family home rentals participating in federal housing programs; and preparing legislative recommendations to codify these policies.",
