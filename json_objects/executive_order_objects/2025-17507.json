    "summary": "The document is an executive order issued by the President of the United States on September 5, 2025, titled 'Modifying the Scope of Reciprocal Tariffs and Establishing Procedures for Implementing Trade and Security Agreements.' The order aims to address large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, which are deemed an unusual and extraordinary threat to national security and the economy. It modifies Annex II of Executive Order 14257, which lists goods exempt from certain ad valorem duties. The order also outlines procedures for implementing trade and security agreements, including the potential reduction or elimination of tariffs for trading partners that align with U.S. economic and national security interests. Key points include the monitoring of trade conditions, the possibility of refunding duties collected, and the delegation of authority to various departments and agencies to implement the order. The document also lists specific Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTSUS) provisions that are added or removed as part of the order.",
