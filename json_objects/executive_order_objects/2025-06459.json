    "title": "Maintaining Acceptable Water Pressure in Showerheads",
    "summary": "The document titled \"Executive Order 14264 of April 9, 2025,\" addresses the regulation of showerheads in the United States. The order emphasizes the belief that overregulation hinders the economy and individual freedoms, specifically criticizing previous administrations for imposing lengthy regulations defining showerheads. \n\nKey elements include:\n\n1. **Purpose**: The order aims to reduce regulatory burdens, citing previous definitions of showerheads as excessively detailed and unnecessary.\n\n2. **Repeal of Regulations**: It directs the Secretary of Energy to rescind the 13,000-word regulation defining showerheads, which was published in December 2021. The repeal will take effect 30 days after the notice is published in the Federal Register.\n\n3. **General Provisions**: The order clarifies that it does not create enforceable rights against the U.S. government and will be implemented in accordance with applicable laws and budgetary constraints.\n\nThe implications of this executive order suggest a shift towards deregulation in consumer product standards, reflecting a broader agenda to enhance personal freedom and reduce government oversight.",
