    "title": "Extending the TikTok Enforcement Delay",
    "summary": "The document outlines Executive Order 14258, issued on April 4, 2025, which extends the enforcement delay of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act concerning TikTok until June 19, 2025. During this extension, the Department of Justice is prohibited from enforcing the Act or imposing penalties for noncompliance related to foreign adversary-controlled applications. The Attorney General is tasked with providing guidance and ensuring that no liability is assigned for actions taken during this period or prior to the order.\n\nKey provisions include the preservation of the Executive's exclusive authority to enforce the Act, preventing state or private enforcement attempts. The order also clarifies that it does not create enforceable rights against the U.S. government or its entities. This extension reflects ongoing national security concerns and aims to provide clarity and protection for entities involved with TikTok during the specified timeframe.",
