    "title": "Restoring American Airspace Sovereignty",
    "summary": "The document titled \"Executive Order 14305 of June 6, 2025,\" outlines the U.S. government's initiative to restore airspace sovereignty in response to threats posed by unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), or drones. It emphasizes the dual potential of drones for public safety and innovation, while also acknowledging their misuse by criminals and hostile actors, including drug cartels and terrorists.\n\nKey findings include:\n\n1. **Purpose and Need for Action**: The order identifies the urgent need to protect American airspace from unlawful UAS operations that threaten public safety, critical infrastructure, and mass gatherings.\n\n2. **Establishment of a Task Force**: A Federal Task Force is created to oversee the development of strategies and solutions to mitigate UAS-related threats, chaired by the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.\n\n3. **Regulatory Measures**: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is tasked with proposing regulations to restrict drone flights over critical facilities and to enhance security assessments in coordination with other federal agencies.\n\n4. **Detection and Enforcement**: The order mandates the use of available technologies for detecting and tracking drones, while also enhancing enforcement of airspace restrictions and proposing legislative changes to strengthen penalties for violations.\n\n5. **Capacity Building**: It includes plans to integrate counter-UAS operations into Joint Terrorism Task Forces and establish a National Training Center for Counter-UAS, focusing on securing major events like the FIFA World Cup 2026 and the 2028 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe implications of this order suggest a proactive approach to drone regulation, aiming to safeguard national security and public safety while navigating the challenges posed by emerging technologies.",
