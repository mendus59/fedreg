    "summary": "Executive Order 14348, issued on September 5, 2025, aims to strengthen efforts to protect U.S. nationals from wrongful detention abroad. The order authorizes the Secretary of State to designate foreign countries as State Sponsors of Wrongful Detention based on specific criteria, including direct engagement in or support for the wrongful detention of U.S. nationals. Upon designation, the Secretary of State can impose various sanctions, travel restrictions, and other measures against the designated country. The order also outlines conditions for terminating such designations and provides definitions for key terms. It emphasizes that the U.S. will not tolerate wrongful detentions, which are seen as affronts to the rule of law and U.S. sovereignty.",
