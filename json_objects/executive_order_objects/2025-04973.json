    "summary": "The document titled \"Executive Order 14239 of March 18, 2025,\" outlines a strategy for enhancing national security and resilience through state and local preparedness. The order emphasizes the importance of empowering state and local governments, alongside individuals, to take active roles in national resilience and preparedness, ultimately benefiting taxpayers and improving efficiency.\n\nKey findings include:\n\n1. **Purpose and Policy**: The order establishes that preparedness is best managed at local levels, supported by the federal government, to effectively address risks like cyber attacks and natural disasters.\n\n2. **National Resilience Strategy**: Within 90 days, a strategy will be published to outline priorities for national resilience, to be reviewed every four years.\n\n3. **Infrastructure and Continuity Policies**: The order mandates a review of critical infrastructure policies within 180 days, shifting from an all-hazards approach to a risk-informed strategy.\n\n4. **Preparedness and Response Policies**: A comprehensive review of national preparedness policies is required within 240 days to reformulate processes and metrics for federal responsibility.\n\n5. **National Risk Register**: A National Risk Register will be developed to identify and quantify risks to national infrastructure, with updates every four years.\n\n6. **Improved Communication**: The order calls for changes to enhance communication between federal and local entities regarding national preparedness.\n\nThe implications of this order suggest a significant shift towards local empowerment in managing risks, which could lead to a more responsive and efficient federal structure, ultimately aiming to save lives and reduce taxpayer burdens.",
