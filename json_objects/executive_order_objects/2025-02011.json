    "title": "Realigning the United States Refugee Admissions Program",
    "summary": "The document outlines Executive Order 14163, issued on January 20, 2025, which realigns the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) in response to record levels of migration. It states that the U.S. is currently unable to absorb large numbers of migrants without compromising resources for American citizens and ensuring their safety. Consequently, the USRAP is suspended until it aligns with U.S. interests.\n\nKey policies include prioritizing public safety and national security in refugee admissions, with a focus on admitting only those who can assimilate fully. Additionally, state and local jurisdictions will have a greater role in determining refugee placement. The Secretary of Homeland Security will assess the feasibility of resuming the program and report back to the President within 90 days, with ongoing assessments every 90 days thereafter.\n\nThe order revokes a previous executive order aimed at enhancing refugee resettlement programs and emphasizes that it does not create enforceable rights against the U.S. government. The implications of this order suggest a significant shift in U.S. refugee policy, focusing on stricter entry criteria and increased local involvement in refugee resettlement decisions.",
