The order establishes the White House Great American Recovery Initiative, co-chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Senior Advisor for Addiction Recovery. This initiative aims to coordinate the federal government's response to addiction by improving treatment access, increasing public awareness, fostering a culture of recovery, and integrating prevention, treatment, and recovery support across various sectors. Key implications include a more coordinated federal approach, increased focus on evidence-based care, and collaboration with states, local communities, and private organizations to address the significant economic and social costs of addiction.",
