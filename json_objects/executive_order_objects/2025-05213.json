    "title": "Improving Education Outcomes by Empowering Parents, States, and Communities",
    "summary": "The document is Executive Order 14242, issued on March 20, 2025, which aims to improve education outcomes by empowering parents, states, and communities. It argues that federal control over education has failed, citing low student performance in reading and math and criticizing the Department of Education's bureaucracy and spending. The order proposes closing the Department of Education and returning educational authority to states and local communities, asserting that this will enhance educational opportunities and accountability.\n\nKey findings include:\n- Federal education spending during the COVID-19 pandemic was approximately $200 billion, with ongoing annual spending exceeding $60 billion.\n- Current educational outcomes are poor, with significant percentages of 8th graders below proficiency in core subjects.\n- The Department of Education is likened to a large bank, managing over $1.6 trillion in student loan debt, but it operates with a much smaller workforce compared to similar entities.\n\nThe implications of this order suggest a significant shift in educational governance, advocating for localized control and accountability while aiming to eliminate practices perceived as discriminatory under the guise of diversity and inclusion initiatives. The order emphasizes the need for rigorous compliance with federal laws in any future allocation of educational funds.",
