    "summary": "Executive Order 14349, issued on September 16, 2025, establishes an emergency board to investigate disputes between the Long Island Rail Road Company and several labor unions, including the Transportation Communications Union and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen. The disputes, unresolved under the Railway Labor Act (RLA), prompted a request for presidential intervention. The emergency board, composed of three members appointed by the President, must report its findings within 30 days. The order also mandates a 120-day freeze on changes to the conditions of the disputes, except by mutual agreement, and specifies the maintenance and termination of the board's records. The Department of Transportation will cover the publication costs of the order.",
