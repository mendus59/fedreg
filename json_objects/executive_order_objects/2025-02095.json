    "title": "Restoring Accountability to Policy-Influencing Positions Within the Federal Workforce",
    "summary": "The document outlines Executive Order 14171, issued by the President on January 20, 2025, aimed at restoring accountability within policy-influencing positions in the Federal workforce. The order emphasizes the need for professionalism and accountability, noting that only 41% of civil service supervisors feel empowered to remove employees for misconduct, and just 26% for poor performance. \n\nKey actions include the reinstatement of Executive Order 13957, which creates a new Policy/Career schedule for certain positions, allowing for greater oversight and potential removal of employees who do not comply with administration policies. The order mandates amendments to existing regulations to facilitate this accountability and revokes Executive Order 14003, which previously aimed to protect the Federal workforce.\n\nThe implications of this order suggest a significant shift in how personnel in policy-influencing roles are managed, reinforcing the expectation that they must support and implement the current administration's policies, with failure to do so leading to dismissal. The order also calls for a review of additional positions that may be included under this new accountability framework, indicating a broader restructuring of workforce management within the Federal government.",
