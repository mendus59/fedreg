    "title": "Saving TikTok While Protecting National Security",
    "summary": "The document is an executive order titled 'Saving TikTok While Protecting National Security,' issued on September 25, 2025. It outlines the background and provisions related to the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which regulates applications like TikTok due to national security concerns. The order details multiple delays in the Act's enforcement and presents a plan for a qualified divestiture of TikTok's U.S. operations. Under this plan, TikTok will be operated by a U.S.-based joint venture, majority-owned by U.S. persons, addressing national security concerns by removing foreign adversary control. The order also specifies actions to be taken by the Attorney General, including a 120-day enforcement delay, and amends previous orders to reflect the new divestiture plan. The goal is to allow continued use of TikTok by Americans while safeguarding national security through strict monitoring and data protection measures.",
