    "title": "Making Federal Architecture Beautiful Again",
    "summary": "Executive Order 14344, issued on August 28, 2025, aims to revise the policies guiding federal architecture to prioritize beauty and public appeal. The order highlights the historical significance of classical architecture in the United States, noting that federal buildings were initially designed to inspire civic virtue and connect with democratic antecedents. However, the shift to modernist and brutalist styles in the 1960s led to unpopular and often unappealing federal buildings. The order establishes that federal public buildings should uplift public spaces, inspire the human spirit, and be visually identifiable as civic buildings. Classical and traditional architecture are preferred, especially in the District of Columbia. The General Services Administration (GSA) is directed to update its policies to align with these principles, ensuring that architects and designs for federal buildings have experience in classical or traditional architecture. The order also mandates that any deviation from preferred architectural styles must be justified and reviewed by the President. The overall goal is to ensure that federal architecture reflects the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the American government and resonates with the American people.",
