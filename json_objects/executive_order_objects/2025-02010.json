    "title": "Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements",
    "summary": "The document titled \"Executive Order 14162\" outlines President Trump's directive, issued on January 20, 2025, to prioritize American interests in international environmental agreements. The purpose is to enhance the U.S. economy while maintaining environmental leadership. The order criticizes previous international agreements, claiming they do not align with U.S. values and unfairly allocate taxpayer funds to other countries.\n\nKey policies include the immediate withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and any similar commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It revokes the U.S. International Climate Finance Plan and mandates relevant agencies to report on actions taken to rescind related policies. The order emphasizes economic efficiency and American prosperity in future energy agreements.\n\nOverall, the implications of this executive order are significant, as it signals a shift away from international climate commitments, potentially affecting global environmental efforts and U.S. relations with other countries regarding climate policy.",
