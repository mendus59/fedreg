    "summary": "The document is an executive order titled \"Saving College Sports,\" issued on July 24, 2025. It highlights the importance of college sports in the United States, providing educational and leadership opportunities to over 500,000 student-athletes annually. The order addresses the threats to college sports, including recent litigation that has led to unlimited athlete compensation and transfers, creating an unbalanced and unsustainable system. It outlines policies to protect and expand women's and non-revenue sports, prohibit third-party pay-for-play payments, and stabilize college athletics through legal protections. The order also directs various federal agencies to develop and implement plans to advance these policies, emphasizing the need to preserve the educational and developmental benefits of collegiate athletics.",
