    "title": "Restoring Common Sense to Federal Office Space Management",
    "summary": "The document presents Executive Order 14274, issued on April 15, 2025, aimed at improving federal office space management. The order revokes previous Executive Orders 12072 and 13006, which prioritized locating federal facilities in central business districts and historic properties, respectively. The intent of these earlier orders was to enhance urban areas but ultimately restricted agencies from relocating to more cost-effective facilities.\n\nKey findings include:\n\n1. **Purpose of the Order**: It seeks to ensure that federal agencies can choose locations that are efficient and cost-effective, ultimately improving service delivery to the American public.\n\n2. **Revocation of Previous Orders**: The order explicitly revokes the two prior executive orders, which are viewed as impediments to efficient federal operations.\n\n3. **Implementation**: The Administrator of General Services is tasked with amending regulations to align federal office space management policies with the new order.\n\n4. **General Provisions**: The order clarifies that it does not affect existing legal authorities of executive departments or the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nOverall, the order reflects a shift towards prioritizing cost efficiency and operational effectiveness in federal office space management, aiming to better serve the needs of the public.",
