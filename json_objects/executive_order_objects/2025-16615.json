    "summary": "Executive Order 14340, issued on August 25, 2025, aims to address a declared crime emergency in Washington, D.C. The order targets the District's cashless bail policies, which are seen as contributing to the release of dangerous criminals. Key measures include ensuring arrestees are held in federal custody, pursuing federal charges for those posing a public safety threat, and reviewing the Metropolitan Police Department's policies. The Attorney General is tasked with determining if the District maintains cashless bail policies and, if so, coordinating with federal agencies to pressure the District to change these policies. The order emphasizes the need to prevent the release of violent and sexual offenders, as well as those involved in property crimes, to ensure public safety.",
