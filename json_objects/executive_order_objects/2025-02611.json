    "title": "Eradicating Anti-Christian Bias",
    "summary": "The document outlines Executive Order 14202, issued on February 6, 2025, aimed at eradicating anti-Christian bias in the United States. The order emphasizes the government's commitment to protecting religious freedoms and addressing perceived injustices against Christians, particularly those stemming from the previous administration's policies. It highlights concerns over the targeting of peaceful Christians, such as pro-life advocates, and the lack of response to violence against Christian institutions.\n\nKey components of the order include the establishment of a Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias, chaired by the Attorney General, which will review and recommend actions against any unlawful anti-Christian policies across various federal agencies. The Task Force is tasked with gathering information, recommending legislative actions, and reporting on its findings over a two-year period.\n\nThe implications of this order are significant, as it signals a shift in federal policy towards actively protecting Christian groups and addressing grievances they have faced, potentially influencing how religious freedoms are interpreted and enforced in the U.S. The order also underscores the administration's stance against perceived hostility towards Christianity in government practices and societal attitudes.",
