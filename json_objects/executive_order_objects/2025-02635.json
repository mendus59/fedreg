It aims to enhance the capacity of these organizations to serve effectively.\n\n4. **Agency Collaboration**: All federal agencies are directed to support the Office's mission, with specific roles assigned to directors of Centers for Faith and the appointment of Faith Liaisons in agencies lacking such centers.\n\n5. **Legal and General Provisions**: The order includes provisions for severability, clarifying that it does not create enforceable rights against the U.S. government, and emphasizes that implementation will align with existing laws and budgetary constraints.\n\nThe establishment of the White House Faith Office signifies a renewed commitment by the federal government to collaborate with faith-based organizations, enhancing their role in community service and protecting religious liberties.",
