    "title": "Honoring Jocelyn Nungaray",
    "summary": "The document is an executive order issued by the President on March 4, 2025, titled \"Honoring Jocelyn Nungaray.\" It addresses the negative impacts of previous immigration policies that allegedly led to increased crime and suffering in the United States, culminating in the tragic murder of 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray in Houston, Texas, by illegal aliens associated with a gang. \n\nKey provisions include:\n\n1. **Purpose and Policy**: The order criticizes prior administrations' immigration policies for contributing to crime and suffering, particularly highlighting the case of Jocelyn Nungaray, who was murdered by individuals released into the U.S. under those policies.\n\n2. **Renaming the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge**: The order mandates that within 30 days, the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge will be renamed to the Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge to honor her memory. The Secretary of the Interior is tasked with updating all federal references to reflect this change.\n\n3. **General Provisions**: The order clarifies that it does not create enforceable rights against the United States or its agencies.\n\nThe implications of this order highlight a strong stance on immigration policy and a commitment to honoring victims of crime linked to illegal immigration, reflecting broader concerns about border security and public safety.",
