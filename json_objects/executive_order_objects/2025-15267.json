    "title": "Addressing Threats to the United States by the Government of the Russian Federation",
    "summary": "Executive Order 14329, issued on August 6, 2025, addresses ongoing threats to the United States posed by the Russian Federation, particularly concerning actions against Ukraine. The order imposes a 25% additional ad valorem duty on imports of articles from India that directly or indirectly import Russian Federation oil. This tariff aims to more effectively address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14066. The duty applies to goods entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after 21 days from the order's date, with exceptions for goods already in transit. The order also outlines monitoring and modification authority, delegation of implementation, and definitions of key terms. It emphasizes that the actions are consistent with applicable laws and do not create enforceable rights or benefits.",
