    "summary": "Executive Order 14359, \"Fostering the Future for American Children and Families,\" issued by the President on November 13, 2025, aims to improve the foster care system. Key findings and implications include: Modernizing the child welfare system by enhancing data collection, transparency, and the use of technology like AI for caregiver recruitment and matching. The order mandates an annual scorecard to evaluate state performance on key child welfare metrics. It also establishes a \"Fostering the Future\" initiative, led by the First Lady, to create educational and employment opportunities for youth transitioning out of foster care, including an online platform for resource navigation and customized success plans. The order seeks to reallocate returned federal funds to support these youth and increase flexibility in training vouchers. Furthermore, it addresses policies that may prohibit qualified individuals or organizations with religious beliefs from participating in federally-funded child-welfare programs and aims to increase partnerships with faith-based organizations.",
