    "summary": "Executive Order 14363, \"Launching the Genesis Mission,\" establishes a national initiative to accelerate scientific discovery and technological innovation through Artificial Intelligence (AI). The mission aims to create an integrated AI platform, the \"American Science and Security Platform,\" to harness federal scientific datasets for training AI models and developing AI agents. This platform will provide high-performance computing, AI modeling frameworks, computational tools, domain-specific foundation models, secure data access, and experimental/production tools. The Secretary of Energy is responsible for implementing the mission, with general leadership and coordination provided by the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology. Key objectives include strengthening national security, securing energy dominance, enhancing workforce productivity, and furthering technological leadership. The order outlines specific timelines for establishing the platform, identifying national science and technology challenges (e.g., advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, energy, quantum science, semiconductors), and fostering interagency and external collaborations. Annual reports will track the platform's operational status, research progress, public-private partnerships, and identify any needs for further support.",
