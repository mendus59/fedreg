    "summary": "The document is an executive order titled \"Ending Crime and Disorder on America's Streets,\" issued on July 24, 2025. It addresses the high number of homeless individuals, many of whom suffer from mental health conditions or substance abuse, and aims to restore public order by focusing on civil commitment and treatment. The order directs the Attorney General and other federal agencies to reverse judicial precedents and consent decrees that impede civil commitment, enforce prohibitions on vagrancy and drug use, and prioritize grants to states and municipalities that comply with these policies. It also redirects federal resources towards evidence-based programs that address the root causes of homelessness and increases accountability in homelessness assistance programs. The order emphasizes the need to protect public safety and ensure that individuals with mental illness or substance use disorders receive appropriate treatment and housing.",
