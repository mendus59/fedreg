    "title": "Designation of Ansar Allah as a Foreign Terrorist Organization",
    "summary": "The document presents Executive Order 14175, issued on January 22, 2025, which designates Ansar Allah, also known as the Houthis, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The order outlines the rationale for this designation, citing the Houthis' collaboration with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, their attacks on U.S. Navy vessels, and numerous assaults on civilian infrastructure in Yemen, Saudi Arabia, and Israel. These actions have jeopardized American personnel and regional stability, as well as disrupted global maritime trade.\n\nThe policy aims to cooperate with regional partners to neutralize the Houthis' capabilities, deprive them of resources, and mitigate their threats. The Secretary of State is mandated to submit a report within 30 days on the designation process, followed by appropriate actions within 15 days. Additionally, a review of USAID's partnerships in Yemen will identify any connections to Ansar Allah, leading to potential termination of related projects.\n\nThe order emphasizes that it does not create enforceable rights or benefits and will be implemented in accordance with applicable laws and appropriations. Overall, the order reflects a strategic shift in U.S. policy towards addressing threats posed by the Houthis in the Middle East.",
