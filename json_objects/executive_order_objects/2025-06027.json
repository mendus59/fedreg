    "title": "Further Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People's Republic of China as Applied to Low-Value Imports",
    "summary": "The document outlines Executive Order 14256, issued on April 2, 2025, which amends duties related to the synthetic opioid supply chain from the People's Republic of China (PRC). The order addresses deceptive shipping practices that allow illicit substances to enter the U.S. under the de minimis exemption. \n\nKey points include:\n\n1. **Purpose**: The order aims to combat the influx of synthetic opioids from the PRC by eliminating the duty-free de minimis treatment for certain low-value products, effective May 2, 2025.\n\n2. **Duty Assessment**: All shipments valued at or under $800 that would qualify for the de minimis exemption will now require formal entry and payment of duties. This includes international postal packages from the PRC or Hong Kong.\n\n3. **Duty Rates**: \n   - An ad valorem duty of 30% will apply to postal items valued at or under $800.\n   - A specific duty of $25 will be imposed on items until June 1, 2025, after which it will increase to $50.\n\n4. **Implementation**: The Secretary of Homeland Security is tasked with implementing this order, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will enforce new reporting and payment requirements for carriers.\n\n5. **Monitoring and Reporting**: The Secretary of Commerce will report on the order's impact on American industries and consumers within 90 days, including recommendations for potential further actions.\n\nThe implications of this order are significant, as it seeks to strengthen enforcement against the trafficking of synthetic opioids, thereby aiming to reduce their availability in the U.S. market.",
