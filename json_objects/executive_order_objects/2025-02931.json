    "summary": "Executive Order 14214, issued on February 14, 2025, addresses the issue of COVID-19 vaccine mandates in educational settings. The order aims to protect personal freedom and parental authority by prohibiting the use of discretionary Federal funds to support educational institutions that require COVID-19 vaccinations for in-person attendance. It emphasizes the low risk of serious illness from COVID-19 for children and young adults and seeks to empower parents with accurate information to make informed decisions.\n\nKey provisions include the requirement for the Secretary of Education to issue guidelines regarding legal obligations related to parental authority and religious freedom, as well as a plan to eliminate coercive vaccine mandates within 90 days. The order also outlines the need to identify non-compliant educational entities and restrict Federal funding accordingly.\n\nOverall, the Executive Order reflects a significant policy shift aimed at enhancing educational access and reducing governmental coercion in vaccine decisions for students.",
