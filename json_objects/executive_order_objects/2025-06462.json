    "title": "Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates To Reflect Trading Partner Retaliation and Alignment",
    "summary": "The document is Executive Order 14266, issued on April 9, 2025, which modifies reciprocal tariff rates in response to trading partner retaliation and aims to align trade practices with national security interests. It builds on a previous order (Executive Order 14257) addressing significant U.S. goods trade deficits, which declared a national emergency and imposed additional duties on imports.\n\nKey points include:\n- The People's Republic of China (PRC) announced an 84% tariff on U.S. goods in retaliation for earlier U.S. tariffs. In response, the order raises tariffs on PRC imports to 125%.\n- The order suspends specific tariff rates for over 75 other foreign trading partners for 90 days, imposing a temporary 10% duty instead, recognizing their efforts to align with U.S. trade policies.\n- A de minimis tariff increase is also implemented, raising certain duties to prevent circumvention of tariffs.\n- The order mandates various U.S. government agencies to take necessary actions for implementation.\n\nOverall, the executive order reflects a strategic approach to trade policy, emphasizing the need for reciprocity and alignment with national security objectives while responding to international trade dynamics.",
