    "title": "Modifying Duties To Address Threats to the United States by the Government of the Russian Federation",
    "summary": "Executive Order 14384, issued on February 6, 2026, modifies duties to address threats posed by the Russian Federation. This order eliminates the additional 25 percent ad valorem duty on imports from India, which was previously imposed by Executive Order 14329. This action is a result of India's commitment to cease direct or indirect importation of Russian Federation oil, its agreement to purchase U.S. energy products, and its ten-year framework to expand defense cooperation with the United States. These steps are deemed sufficient to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14066 and align India with U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economic interests. The order also establishes a monitoring mechanism, led by the Secretary of Commerce, to track India's adherence to these commitments, with provisions for potential re-imposition of duties if India resumes importing Russian oil.",
