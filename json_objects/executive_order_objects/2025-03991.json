    "title": "Amendment to Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Southern Border",
    "summary": "The document is an Executive Order (14232) issued on March 6, 2025, addressing the flow of illicit drugs across the southern border of the United States. It emphasizes the importance of the automotive industry to U.S. employment and economic security, noting that current trade practices significantly involve the exchange of automotive parts with Mexico. \n\nKey modifications include:\n1. Articles from Mexico that are duty-free under specific trade agreements will not face additional tariffs imposed in a previous order.\n2. The tariff on potash will be reduced from 25% to 10%.\n3. These changes take effect on March 7, 2025, for goods entered for consumption.\n\nThe order clarifies that it does not affect the authority of executive departments or create enforceable rights against the U.S. government. Overall, the order aims to balance trade considerations with the need to address drug trafficking issues.",
