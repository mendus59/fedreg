    "summary": "Executive Order 14362, issued on November 24, 2025, initiates a process to designate certain chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists. The order cites the organization's transnational network and specific activities of its chapters in Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, including facilitating violence and supporting attacks against Israel and U.S. interests, as justification. The policy aims to eliminate the capabilities and operations of these designated chapters, deprive them of resources, and end threats to U.S. nationals and national security. The Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury are tasked with submitting a joint report within 30 days and taking appropriate designation actions within 45 days.",
