    "title": "Addressing Certain Tariffs on Imported Articles",
    "summary": "The document titled \"Executive Order 14289 of April 29, 2025\" addresses the issue of overlapping tariffs on imported articles in the United States. It establishes a framework to prevent the cumulative effect of multiple tariffs that may apply to the same article, which could exceed necessary levels for achieving policy goals related to national security and economic stability.\n\nKey findings include:\n- The order outlines specific actions and proclamations that have previously imposed tariffs, which include adjustments on automobiles, aluminum, and steel imports, as well as duties related to the flow of illicit drugs across U.S. borders.\n- It specifies that an article subject to tariffs under one listed action will not incur additional tariffs from others, thereby preventing tariff stacking.\n- The order allows for certain combinations of tariffs to coexist if they meet specified conditions, ensuring that the separate actions remain valid and enforceable.\n\nImplications of this order include:\n- A streamlined tariff application process that may reduce the financial burden on importers by eliminating excessive tariff overlaps.\n- Clear guidelines for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other agencies to implement the policy effectively, with updates to regulations and the Harmonized Tariff Schedule as necessary.\n- The order is retroactive to March 4, 2025, indicating that affected importers may be eligible for refunds under specified conditions.\n\nOverall, this executive order seeks to enhance the efficiency and clarity of tariff administration while safeguarding U.S. economic interests.",
