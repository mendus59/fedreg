    "title": "Enforcing the Hyde Amendment",
    "summary": "The document outlines Executive Order 14182, issued on January 24, 2025, which enforces the Hyde Amendment, a long-standing policy that prohibits federal funding for elective abortions. The order emphasizes the consensus that taxpayers should not be compelled to fund such procedures. It revokes two previous executive orders that allowed for federal funding of elective abortions, signaling a shift back to stricter adherence to the Hyde Amendment. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is tasked with providing guidance for implementation. The order clarifies that it does not create enforceable rights against the U.S. government or its entities. Overall, this executive action reinforces a policy aimed at limiting federal involvement in abortion funding.",
