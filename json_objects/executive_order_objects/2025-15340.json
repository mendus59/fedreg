    "title": "Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors",
    "summary": "Executive Order 14330, issued on August 7, 2025, aims to democratize access to alternative assets for 401(k) and other defined-contribution retirement plan participants. The order highlights that while wealthy Americans and government workers have access to alternative assets, over 90 million Americans in employer-sponsored plans do not. The order directs the Secretary of Labor to reexamine and clarify guidance on fiduciary duties related to offering asset allocation funds that include alternative assets, which encompass private market investments, real estate, digital assets, commodities, infrastructure projects, and longevity income strategies. The order also encourages the SEC to facilitate access to these assets in participant-directed plans. The goal is to enhance long-term net returns and diversification opportunities for retirement savers, while protecting fiduciaries from burdensome litigation.",
