    "title": "Reforming Accreditation To Strengthen Higher Education",
    "summary": "The document titled \"Executive Order 14279 of April 23, 2025\" addresses the reform of higher education accreditation to enhance quality and accountability. It highlights that current accreditors have failed to uphold their responsibilities, approving low-quality institutions and imposing discriminatory practices under the guise of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) standards. The order emphasizes the need for accreditation to focus on student outcomes rather than ideological compliance.\n\nKey findings include:\n- The national six-year undergraduate graduation rate was only 64% in 2020, with many accredited programs yielding poor financial returns for graduates.\n- Some accrediting bodies, such as the American Bar Association and the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, have been criticized for requiring diversity commitments that violate federal laws.\n- The Executive Order mandates that the Secretary of Education hold accreditors accountable for unlawful actions and reform accreditation standards to prioritize high-quality education free from discrimination.\n\nThe implications of this order are significant:\n- It aims to ensure that federal funds are allocated to institutions that provide quality education and are not engaged in unlawful discriminatory practices.\n- The Secretary of Education is tasked with implementing new principles of accreditation, promoting competition and accountability, and supporting intellectual diversity.\n- The order seeks to streamline accreditation processes and improve the overall quality of higher education in the United States.",
