    "title": "Designating Fentanyl as a Weapon of Mass Destruction",
    "summary": "Executive Order 14367 designates illicit fentanyl and its core precursor chemicals as Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). The order highlights that fentanyl is more akin to a chemical weapon than a narcotic due to its extreme potency, with a lethal dose of just two milligrams. It emphasizes the threat posed by fentanyl to national security, fueled by organized criminal networks and Foreign Terrorist Organizations that use drug profits to fund illicit activities. The order mandates relevant executive departments and agencies to take action, including pursuing investigations and prosecutions, imposing sanctions on financial institutions and assets involved in fentanyl trafficking, determining the need for Department of War resources to aid the Department of Justice, updating military directives for chemical incident response to include fentanyl, and identifying fentanyl smuggling threat networks using WMD-related intelligence. The order defines illicit fentanyl and core precursor chemicals and includes general provisions regarding its implementation and legal scope.",
