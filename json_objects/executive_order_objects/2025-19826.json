    "title": "Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates Consistent With the Economic and Trade Arrangement Between the United States and the People's Republic of China",
    "summary": "Executive Order 14358, issued on November 4, 2025, modifies reciprocal tariff rates between the United States and the People's Republic of China (PRC) consistent with a new economic and trade arrangement. This order stems from previous executive orders addressing large and persistent U.S. goods trade deficits and retaliatory actions by the PRC. Following a meeting between President Xi Jinping and the U.S. President on October 30, 2025, the \"Kuala Lumpur Joint Arrangement\" was reached. Under this arrangement, the PRC commits to eliminating coercive export controls on rare earth elements and critical minerals, addressing retaliation against U.S. semiconductor companies, and purchasing U.S. agricultural exports. In return, the U.S. commits to maintaining the suspension of heightened reciprocal tariffs on PRC imports until November 10, 2026. The order declares that this arrangement will help remedy non-reciprocal trade, reduce the U.S. trade deficit, boost the U.S. economy, and secure access to vital materials. Key findings include the PRC's commitment to specific trade actions and the U.S. reciprocal commitment to suspend tariffs. The implications are a potential reduction in trade deficits, economic strengthening for the U.S., and improved access to critical resources. The order also establishes a monitoring mechanism for the underlying conditions of the national emergency and the PRC's implementation of its commitments, with the possibility of modifying the order if the PRC fails to comply.",
