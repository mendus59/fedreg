    "title": "Addressing the Threat to National Security From Imports of Timber, Lumber, and Their Derivative Products",
    "summary": "The document outlines Executive Order 14223, issued on March 1, 2025, which addresses national security concerns related to the importation of timber, lumber, and related products. It emphasizes the importance of the wood products industry to the U.S. economy and national security, highlighting vulnerabilities due to reliance on imported materials, despite the U.S. having sufficient domestic timber resources to meet 95% of its softwood consumption.\n\nThe order mandates an investigation by the Secretary of Commerce to assess the impact of imported wood products on national security, considering factors such as domestic production capacity, foreign competition, and the effects of foreign subsidies. The Secretary is required to consult with the Secretary of Defense and other relevant agencies, and to report back within 270 days with findings and recommendations for potential actions, including tariffs or incentives to bolster domestic production.\n\nOverall, the Executive Order aims to ensure a reliable domestic supply chain for timber and lumber, thereby enhancing national security and economic resilience.",
