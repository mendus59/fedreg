    "title": "Declassification of Records Concerning the Assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.",
    "summary": "The document is an Executive Order issued on January 23, 2025, focusing on the declassification of records related to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. It emphasizes the need for transparency and public interest in releasing these long-held records, as the Federal Government has not fully disclosed them despite the passage of over 50 years since the events.\n\nKey points include:\n\n- The Executive Order recognizes that the continued withholding of records is inconsistent with public interest.\n- It mandates the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General to develop a plan for the release of JFK assassination records within 15 days.\n- A similar review and plan for the records concerning Robert F. Kennedy and Dr. King must be completed within 45 days.\n- The order aims to ensure that all relevant records are disclosed, promoting transparency and accountability regarding these significant historical events.\n\nThe implications of this order suggest a significant shift towards greater openness in government regarding historical records, potentially impacting public understanding of these pivotal moments in American history.",
