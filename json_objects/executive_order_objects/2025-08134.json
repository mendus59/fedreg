    "title": "Establishment of the Religious Liberty Commission",
    "summary": "The document outlines Executive Order 14291, issued on May 1, 2025, which establishes the Religious Liberty Commission aimed at reinforcing and promoting religious liberty protections in the United States. The order emphasizes the historical significance of religious freedom, tracing its roots to early American settlers and the First Amendment.\n\nKey findings include:\n1. The executive branch's commitment to enforce robust protections for religious liberty against recent threats posed by various federal, state, and local policies.\n2. The formation of the Religious Liberty Commission, comprising up to 14 members appointed by the President, to provide diverse perspectives on defending religious liberty.\n3. The Commission's mandate to produce a comprehensive report addressing the foundations of religious liberty, current threats, and strategies for its preservation, as well as to advise on related policies.\n4. The establishment of advisory boards consisting of religious leaders, lay leaders, and legal experts to support the Commission's work.\n\nThe implications of this order suggest a renewed federal focus on religious liberty, potentially influencing policies and practices at various governmental levels and encouraging public awareness and participation in safeguarding this fundamental right. The Commission is set to terminate on July 4, 2026, unless extended, marking the 250th anniversary of American Independence.",
