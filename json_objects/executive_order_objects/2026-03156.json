    "summary": "Executive Order 14386, titled \"Strengthening United States National Defense With Americas Beautiful Clean Coal Power Generation Fleet,\" emphasizes the critical role of a reliable electric grid for national defense and economic stability. It mandates the Department of War (DOW), in coordination with the Department of Energy, to prioritize the preservation and strategic use of coal-based energy assets. This includes entering into long-term Power Purchase Agreements with coal-fired facilities to supply DOW installations and mission-critical facilities, with a focus on enhancing grid reliability, on-site fuel security, and mission assurance for defense and intelligence capabilities. The order asserts that coal is essential for national and economic security, particularly in addressing the declared national energy emergency.",
