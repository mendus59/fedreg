    "title": "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports",
    "summary": "The document is an Executive Order 14201 issued on February 5, 2025, titled \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports.\" It aims to protect opportunities for women and girls in competitive sports by prohibiting male participation in women's categories, asserting that such participation is unfair and dangerous. The order emphasizes the importance of Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, which mandates equal opportunities in sports for women.\n\nKey findings include:\n- The policy rescinds federal funding to educational programs that allow men to compete in women's sports, citing the need for fairness, safety, and dignity for female athletes.\n- The Secretary of Education is tasked with enforcing Title IX to ensure that women's sports remain exclusive to biological women.\n- The order calls for the review of athletic policies at both national and international levels, promoting sex-based categories in sports rather than those based on gender identity.\n\nImplications of the order suggest a significant shift in federal policy regarding gender and sports, aiming to prioritize biological sex in athletic competitions and potentially impacting funding and support for educational institutions that do not comply. The order also seeks to align international sporting standards with its policies, reinforcing the exclusion of males from women's sports.",
