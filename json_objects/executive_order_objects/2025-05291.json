    "title": "Addressing Remedial Action by Paul Weiss",
    "summary": "The document is an Executive Order (14244) issued by the President on March 21, 2025, which revokes a previous order (14237) addressing risks associated with the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP. The background highlights that Paul Weiss had previously participated in activities undermining the judicial process. However, the firm has now committed to significant policy changes, including political neutrality in client selection, a broad range of pro bono work, merit-based hiring, and a substantial investment in legal services aimed at various social causes. The order expresses optimism that these changes could benefit American communities and strengthen national unity. Additionally, it clarifies that the order does not create enforceable rights against the U.S. government.",
