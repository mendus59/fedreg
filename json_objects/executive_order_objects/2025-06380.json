    "summary": "The document titled \"Executive Order 14261 of April 8, 2025\" outlines a comprehensive strategy to reinvigorate the American coal industry to enhance national economic prosperity and energy security. Key objectives include increasing domestic coal production, promoting coal exports, and removing regulatory barriers that hinder coal mining and usage. \n\nThe order emphasizes coal's role in meeting rising electricity demands, particularly for emerging technologies like artificial intelligence data centers, and aims to create high-paying jobs while supporting allies through energy exports. It mandates federal agencies to identify coal resources on federal lands, expedite coal leasing processes, and reassess policies that discourage coal production. \n\nAdditionally, the order promotes the development and commercialization of coal technologies and seeks to integrate coal as a critical material in steel production. It also highlights the importance of coal-powered infrastructure in supporting AI operations.\n\nOverall, the executive order reflects a strong commitment to revitalizing the coal sector, positioning it as essential for future energy needs and economic stability in the U.S.",
