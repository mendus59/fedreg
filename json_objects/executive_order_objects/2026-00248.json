The order mandates HieFo to divest all interests in these assets within 180 days, prohibits granting access to these assets or related information to unauthorized personnel, and requires strict compliance measures overseen by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). CFIUS is authorized to audit HieFo, verify the divestment, and impose conditions to mitigate national security risks. The Attorney General is tasked with enforcing the order.",
