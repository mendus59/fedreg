    "title": "Creating Schedule G in the Excepted Service",
    "summary": "The document is an executive order issued on July 17, 2025, which creates Schedule G in the excepted service for noncareer positions of a policy-making or policy-advocating character that are normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition. The order amends Civil Service Rule VI to include Schedule G and outlines the conditions and procedures for appointments under this new schedule. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management is tasked with implementing the order and adopting necessary regulations. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is directed to consider the suitability of prospective appointees in representing the President's policies without regard to their political affiliation or activity. The order emphasizes that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits and is to be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.",
