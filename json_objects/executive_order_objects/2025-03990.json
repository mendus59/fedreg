    "title": "Amendment to Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border",
    "summary": "The document outlines Executive Order 14231, issued on March 6, 2025, which amends duties to address the flow of illicit drugs across the northern border of the United States. The order emphasizes the importance of the American automotive industry for employment and national security, stating that adjustments to tariffs on automotive parts from Canada are necessary to prevent disruption.\n\nKey provisions include:\n\n1. Articles from Canada that qualify for duty-free entry under specific tariff schedules will not face additional duties imposed by a previous order.\n2. The additional tariff on potash will be reduced from 25% to 10%.\n3. These modifications will take effect for goods entered for consumption starting March 7, 2025.\n\nThe order clarifies that it does not affect the authority of executive departments or create enforceable rights against the U.S. government. Overall, the order aims to balance drug enforcement measures with the economic stability of the automotive sector.",
