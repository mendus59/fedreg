    "title": "Designating Cartels and Other Organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists",
    "summary": "The document is an Executive Order issued on January 20, 2025, designating certain international cartels and transnational organizations, such as Tren de Aragua and La Mara Salvatrucha, as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists. The order emphasizes that these groups pose a significant national security threat due to their violent campaigns, infiltration into foreign governments, and control over illegal activities, particularly along the U.S.-Mexico border. \n\nKey findings include:\n\n1. **National Security Threat**: The cartels are described as a greater threat than traditional organized crime, engaging in violence that destabilizes countries and affects U.S. safety.\n2. **International Emergency Declaration**: The order declares a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to address the threats posed by these organizations.\n3. **Policy for Elimination**: It establishes a U.S. policy aimed at eliminating the presence and influence of these organizations within the U.S. and protecting national integrity.\n4. **Implementation Actions**: The order mandates the Secretary of State and other officials to recommend designations and prepare operational measures to combat these threats within 14 days.\n\nOverall, the order reflects a strong stance against the influence of cartels and similar groups, aiming to bolster U.S. security and stability in the Western Hemisphere.",
