    "title": "Increasing Efficiency at the Office of the Federal Register",
    "summary": "Executive Order 14295, issued on May 9, 2025, aims to enhance efficiency at the Office of the Federal Register by addressing delays in the publication of regulatory actions. The order emphasizes the importance of deregulation for fostering economic prosperity and seeks to streamline the administrative process of removing regulations from the Code of Federal Regulations. \n\nKey provisions include:\n\n1. **Reducing Publication Delays**: The Archivist of the United States is tasked with collaborating with the Government Publishing Office to modernize systems and eliminate bureaucracy, aiming to decrease the time it takes to publish new regulations.\n\n2. **Fee Review**: Within 45 days, the Archivist must evaluate the publication fee structure to ensure it reflects actual costs and incorporates efficiencies gained from the order.\n\n3. **Reporting Requirements**: The Archivist will provide reports to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on average publication times and fee calculations, ensuring transparency and accountability.\n\nThe order is designed to minimize taxpayer costs associated with regulatory publication and to support the administration's deregulatory agenda, ultimately fostering a more efficient regulatory environment. It does not create enforceable rights or benefits against the U.S. government.",
