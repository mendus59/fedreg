    "title": "Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People's Republic of China",
    "summary": "The document is an executive order issued by the President on February 5, 2025, which amends previous directives concerning the synthetic opioid supply chain in the People's Republic of China. The key amendment replaces a subsection regarding duty-free de minimis treatment for eligible articles. This treatment will end upon notification from the Secretary of Commerce that systems are in place to process and collect tariff revenue for these articles.\n\nThe order clarifies that it does not affect the authority of executive departments or the functions of the Office of Management and Budget. Additionally, it states that the order does not create enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities.\n\nOverall, the amendment signifies a shift in policy aimed at enhancing tariff collection related to the synthetic opioid supply chain, reflecting ongoing efforts to address the opioid crisis.",
