    "title": "Withdrawing the United States From and Ending Funding to Certain United Nations Organizations and Reviewing United States Support to All International Organizations",
    "summary": "The document outlines Executive Order 14199, issued by the President on February 4, 2025, which withdraws the United States from certain United Nations organizations and ends funding to them. The order emphasizes a reevaluation of U.S. support for international organizations due to perceived failures in the UN's mission, particularly highlighting the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), UNESCO, and the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).\n\nKey findings include:\n\n1. **Withdrawal from UN Bodies**: The U.S. will not participate in the UNHRC and will conduct a review of its membership in UNESCO, focusing on how these organizations align with U.S. interests and their stance on anti-Semitism.\n\n2. **Funding Cuts**: The order prohibits U.S. funding to UNRWA and the UNHRC, reflecting concerns over their actions and affiliations, particularly regarding terrorism and human rights abuses.\n\n3. **Comprehensive Review**: Within 180 days, a review will be conducted on all international organizations the U.S. supports, assessing whether they serve U.S. interests and if reform is possible.\n\n4. **Notification to UN**: The Secretary will inform UN leadership about the cessation of U.S. funding and obligations related to these organizations.\n\nThe implications of this order suggest a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy, prioritizing national interests over international cooperation, and potentially straining relationships with allies and international bodies.",
