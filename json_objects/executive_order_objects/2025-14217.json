    "summary": "The document is an executive order titled \"Preventing Woke AI in the Federal Government,\" issued on July 23, 2025. It aims to prevent the use of AI models in federal procurement that prioritize ideological agendas, such as diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), over truthfulness and accuracy. The order establishes two key principles for AI models: truth-seeking and ideological neutrality, requiring them to prioritize historical accuracy and avoid manipulating responses for ideological purposes. It mandates that agencies procure only AI models developed in accordance with these principles and provides guidelines for implementation and compliance. The order also specifies that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits and is subject to applicable laws and available appropriations.",
