    "title": "Further Modifying the Reciprocal Tariff Rates",
    "summary": "Executive Order 14326, issued on July 31, 2025, modifies reciprocal tariff rates to address persistent U.S. goods trade deficits, which are deemed a threat to national security and the economy. The order adjusts tariffs based on the progress of trade negotiations and the alignment of foreign trading partners with U.S. economic and national security interests. Specific tariff modifications are outlined in Annex I and Annex II, with changes taking effect seven days after the order's issuance. The order also includes provisions to prevent transshipment to evade tariffs and directs relevant agencies to implement and monitor the new tariff rates. The goal is to rectify trade imbalances and encourage foreign partners to address trade barriers that contribute to the declared national emergency.",
