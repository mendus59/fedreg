    "title": "Addressing Threats to the United States by the Government of Brazil",
    "summary": "The document is an executive order issued by the President of the United States on July 30, 2025, addressing threats posed by the Brazilian government to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States. The order declares a national emergency due to actions by the Brazilian government that interfere with the U.S. economy, infringe on free expression rights, violate human rights, and undermine the rule of law in Brazil. It highlights the targeting of political opponents, suppression of dissent, and coercion of U.S. companies to censor content and provide user data. The order imposes a 40% additional ad valorem duty on certain products imported from Brazil, effective seven days after the order's date, with specific exemptions and modifications outlined. The document also authorizes the Secretary of State and other officials to monitor the situation, recommend additional actions, and modify the order as necessary, including in response to retaliatory actions by Brazil.",
