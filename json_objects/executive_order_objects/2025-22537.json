    "summary": "Executive Order 14364, issued by the President on December 6, 2025, addresses security risks stemming from price fixing and anti-competitive behavior within the food supply chain. The order establishes Food Supply Chain Security Task Forces within the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether anti-competitive practices, particularly by foreign-controlled corporations, are increasing food costs for Americans and posing national security threats. These task forces are mandated to take necessary actions to remedy any uncovered anti-competitive behavior, including enforcement actions, regulatory proposals, and, if criminal collusion is found, criminal proceedings. The task forces will provide progress briefings to congressional leadership within 180 and 365 days of the order's issuance, excluding sensitive investigation details.",
