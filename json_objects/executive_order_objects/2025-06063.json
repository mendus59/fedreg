    "title": "Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits",
    "summary": "The document is Executive Order 14257, issued by President Donald J. Trump on April 2, 2025, which aims to regulate imports with a reciprocal tariff to address trade practices contributing to significant U.S. goods trade deficits. The order declares a national emergency due to the ongoing trade deficits, which have reached $1.2 trillion, and identifies a lack of reciprocity in trade relationships, disparate tariff rates, and non-tariff barriers as primary causes.\n\nKey findings include:\n1. U.S. manufacturing has been adversely affected, leading to job losses and a decline in domestic production capacity, particularly in critical sectors like defense and technology.\n2. The U.S. has one of the lowest average tariff rates globally, while many trading partners impose significantly higher tariffs, creating an unbalanced trading environment.\n3. Non-tariff barriers, such as import restrictions and inadequate intellectual property protections, further disadvantage U.S. manufacturers.\n\nThe executive order establishes a policy to impose additional ad valorem duties starting at 10% on imports from all trading partners, with increased rates for specific countries listed in an annex. The aim is to rebalance trade flows and enhance U.S. economic and national security by reducing reliance on foreign goods and bolstering domestic manufacturing.\n\nOverall, the order reflects a shift in U.S. trade policy towards more protectionist measures in response to longstanding trade imbalances, emphasizing the need for domestic manufacturing capacity to ensure national security and economic resilience.",
