    "title": "Promoting the National Defense by Ensuring an Adequate Supply of Elemental Phosphorus and Glyphosate- Based Herbicides",
    "summary": "Executive Order 14387, signed on February 18, 2026, declares elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides as critical to national defense and food security. The order highlights that elemental phosphorus is vital for defense technologies like semiconductors, illumination devices, and battery chemistries, and has been designated a critical mineral. Glyphosate-based herbicides are essential for agricultural productivity, with no direct substitutes, and are crucial for maintaining America's agricultural advantage and rural economy. The United States faces a limited domestic production capacity for both, relying on imports and having only one domestic producer that does not meet national needs. This vulnerability threatens national security and military readiness. The order delegates authority to the Secretary of Agriculture to ensure an adequate supply of these materials, prioritizing domestic production and protecting the viability of domestic producers. It also confers immunity to producers complying with the order.",
