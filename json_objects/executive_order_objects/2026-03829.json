    "summary": "Executive Order 14388, issued on February 20, 2026, continues the suspension of duty-free de minimis treatment for all countries. This action is taken under various authorities, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, to address national emergencies declared in previous executive orders related to illicit drug flow, border security, synthetic opioid supply chains, and trade deficits. The order revises Executive Order 14324, stating that de minimis exemption will not apply to shipments regardless of value, origin, or transportation method, except for those sent through the international postal network. For postal shipments, duties will be collected based on rates specified in a Proclamation dated February 20, 2026, until a new entry process is established by CBP. The order also mandates that carriers or approved parties must collect and remit these duties, and country of origin and value must be declared for dutiable postal items. This order is effective for goods entered for consumption on or after February 24, 2026.",
