    "title": "Ending Certain Tariff Actions",
    "summary": "Executive Order 14389, issued on February 20, 2026, terminates certain tariff actions previously imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). These tariffs were enacted through various executive orders starting in February 2025, addressing national emergencies related to illicit drug flow, border situations, the synthetic opioid supply chain, Venezuelan oil imports, trade deficits, and threats from Brazil, Russia, Cuba, and Iran. While the specific ad valorem duties are being removed and collection ceased as soon as practicable, the underlying national emergencies declared in those previous orders remain in effect. The order directs agencies to take necessary steps for implementation, including potential modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. Importantly, this order does not affect other duties, such as those imposed under section 232 or section 301 of existing trade acts.",
