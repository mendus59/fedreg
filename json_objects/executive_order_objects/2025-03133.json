    "summary": "The document is an Executive Order 14217 issued on February 19, 2025, aimed at significantly reducing the size of the Federal Government and increasing its accountability. The order outlines the elimination of non-statutory components and functions from several governmental entities, including the Presidio Trust and the United States Institute of Peace, among others. Heads of these entities must report compliance within 14 days, confirming which functions are legally required.\n\nAdditionally, the order instructs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to reject funding requests inconsistent with the order and revokes previous memoranda and regulations related to Federal Executive Boards and the Presidential Management Fellows Program. It also mandates the termination of specific Federal Advisory Committees within various agencies.\n\nThe overarching goal is to minimize government waste, reduce inflation, and promote freedom and innovation in the United States. The order emphasizes that its implementation will adhere to applicable laws and budgetary constraints, and it does not create enforceable rights against the government.",
