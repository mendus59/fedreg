    "title": "Reinstating Service Members Discharged Under the Military's COVID-19 Vaccination Mandate",
    "summary": "The document outlines Executive Order 14184, issued on January 27, 2025, which reinstates military service members who were discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccination mandated by the Department of Defense. The order acknowledges the mandate as an unfair burden and states that many discharges were unjust, calling for overdue federal redress.\n\nKey provisions include:\n- Reinstatement for all military members (active and reserve) who were discharged solely for vaccine refusal, upon their request.\n- Restoration of former rank and full back pay, benefits, and bonuses for reinstated service members.\n- Allowing those who voluntarily left service to return without adverse effects on their status or compensation.\n\nThe order also mandates a report to the President within 60 days on the implementation progress and clarifies that it does not preclude disciplinary actions for conduct violations under military law. Overall, the executive order aims to address grievances related to the COVID-19 vaccine mandate and restore service members' rights.",
