    "title": "Withdrawing the United States From the World Health Organization",
    "summary": "The document outlines Executive Order 14155, signed by the President on January 20, 2025, which officially withdraws the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO). The withdrawal is justified by the U.S. government's criticisms of the WHO's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, perceived lack of necessary reforms, and disproportionate financial contributions compared to countries like China.\n\nKey actions included in the order are:\n- Revocation of the previous Presidential letter retracting the withdrawal notice from 2020.\n- Revocation of Executive Order 13987, which aimed to organize U.S. efforts in combating COVID-19.\n- Establishment of new mechanisms within the National Security Council to enhance public health and biosecurity.\n- Immediate cessation of U.S. government funding and personnel support to the WHO.\n- A halt to negotiations regarding the WHO Pandemic Agreement and amendments to the International Health Regulations.\n\nThe Secretary of State is tasked with notifying relevant parties of the withdrawal, and the order emphasizes that it does not create enforceable rights against the U.S. government. This decision reflects a significant shift in U.S. global health policy and raises questions about future international cooperation on health issues.",
