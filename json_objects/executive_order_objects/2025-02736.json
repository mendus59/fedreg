    "title": "Pausing Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Enforcement To Further American Economic and National Security",
    "summary": "The document outlines Executive Order 14209, issued on February 10, 2025, which pauses enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for 180 days to enhance American economic and national security. The order asserts that the FCPA has been misapplied, negatively impacting U.S. foreign policy and economic competitiveness. \n\nKey points include:\n\n1. **Purpose**: The FCPA has been stretched beyond its intended scope, harming U.S. interests and wasting prosecutorial resources.\n2. **Policy of Enforcement Discretion**: During the review period, the Attorney General is instructed to halt new FCPA investigations, reassess existing cases, and issue updated guidelines to align enforcement with presidential foreign policy goals.\n3. **Severability and General Provisions**: The order includes clauses ensuring that if any part is invalidated, the rest remains in effect, and clarifies that it does not create enforceable rights against the U.S. government.\n\nOverall, the executive order aims to revise the enforcement of the FCPA to better support American businesses and national interests in international markets.",
