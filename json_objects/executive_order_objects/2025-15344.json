    "title": "Improving Oversight of Federal Grantmaking",
    "summary": "Executive Order 14332, issued on August 7, 2025, aims to improve oversight of federal grant-making to prevent wasteful spending and ensure alignment with national interests. Key concerns include grants funding ideologically driven projects, unsafe research, and activities against American interests. The order mandates stronger review processes for grant announcements and awards, emphasizing accountability, transparency, and alignment with presidential policy priorities. It prohibits funding for racial preferences, illegal immigration, and other harmful initiatives, and encourages grants to a diverse range of recipients. The order also revises uniform guidance to streamline application requirements and limit administrative costs, ensuring grants can be terminated if they no longer serve national interests.",
