    "title": "Partial Revocation of Executive Order 13961",
    "summary": "The document is an Executive Order (14146) issued on January 19, 2025, which partially revokes Executive Order 13961 from December 7, 2020, concerning Governance and Integration of Federal Mission Resilience. It specifically revokes Sections 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7 of the previous order, renumbers the remaining sections, and makes amendments to clarify terms and committees involved. \n\nKey implications include the restructuring of oversight committees related to national security, as the revoked sections may have contained provisions that affected federal resilience strategies. The order emphasizes that it does not create enforceable rights for any parties against the U.S. government or its entities. Overall, this action reflects a shift in federal governance regarding mission resilience and national continuity policy.",
