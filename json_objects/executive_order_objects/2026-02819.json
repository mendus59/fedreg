    "title": "Protecting the National Security and Welfare of the United States and Its Citizens From Criminal Actors and Other Public Safety Threats",
    "summary": "Executive Order 14385, signed by the President on February 6, 2026, aims to protect the national security and welfare of the United States and its citizens from criminal actors and public safety threats. The policy emphasizes safeguarding the nation from foreign nationals with criminal histories who violate immigration laws or intend to break U.S. criminal laws. It also promotes cooperation with trusted foreign governments by sharing information on convicted felons reciprocally for border security and immigration purposes. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is tasked with interdicting illegal entries, preventing the entry of dangerous goods, and detecting threats like terrorists and smugglers. To achieve these goals, DHS immigration authorities will be granted maximum legal access to criminal history record information (CHRI) held by Federal criminal justice agencies. Specifically, the Attorney General will provide DHS with access to CHRI from the Department of Justice for screening and vetting missions. Furthermore, the Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized to exchange CHRI with Visa Waiver Program countries, countries with serious crime prevention agreements, and other trusted allies. This exchange will be for the sole purpose of screening travelers and immigrants and will be based on reciprocity, with agreements containing safeguards for privacy. The order also includes general provisions clarifying authorities and stating that it does not create new legal rights or benefits.",
