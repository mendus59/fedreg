    "title": "Amendment to Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border",
    "summary": "The document is an Executive Order (14226) issued on March 2, 2025, aimed at amending duties related to the flow of illicit drugs across the northern border of the United States. The order revises a previous Executive Order (14193) by establishing that duty-free de minimis treatment for certain covered articles will end once the Secretary of Commerce notifies the President that adequate systems for processing and collecting tariff revenue are in place. \n\nKey provisions include:\n\n- The amendment to the existing duty structure, specifically concerning articles eligible for duty-free treatment.\n- Clarification that the order does not affect the authority of executive departments or the functions of the Office of Management and Budget.\n- The implementation of the order is subject to applicable laws and available appropriations.\n\nOverall, this order reflects ongoing efforts to address drug trafficking while ensuring that customs processes are efficient and effective. It emphasizes the importance of proper systems in place for tariff collection before the continuation of duty-free benefits.",
