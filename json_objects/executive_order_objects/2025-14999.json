    "summary": "The document is an executive order issued by the President on July 31, 2025, titled \"Amendment to Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border.\" It increases the additional ad valorem rate of duty from 25% to 35% on certain articles from Canada, citing Canada's lack of cooperation in stemming the flow of illicit drugs like fentanyl. The order also introduces a 40% duty on transshipped goods from Canada that evade applicable duties. It mandates ongoing monitoring and potential further action if Canada does not address the drug crisis or retaliates against the U.S. The order delegates authority to the Secretary of Homeland Security to implement these measures and collaborate with other agencies.",
