    "title": "A Plan for Establishing a United States Sovereign Wealth Fund",
    "summary": "The document outlines Executive Order 14196, issued by the President on February 3, 2025, which establishes a plan for creating a United States Sovereign Wealth Fund. The primary objective of this fund is to enhance the long-term financial health and international standing of the U.S. It aims to maximize the stewardship of national wealth for the benefit of American citizens, promoting fiscal sustainability, reducing tax burdens on families and small businesses, and ensuring economic security for future generations.\n\nKey provisions include the requirement for the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, to develop a detailed plan for the fund within 90 days. This plan will cover funding mechanisms, investment strategies, governance models, and legal considerations necessary for its establishment and management.\n\nThe order emphasizes that it does not alter existing legal authorities or create enforceable rights against the U.S. government. Overall, the establishment of the sovereign wealth fund is positioned as a strategic initiative to bolster economic leadership and security for the nation.",
