    "title": "Suspending Duty-Free De Minimis Treatment for All Countries",
    "summary": "The document is an executive order issued by the President of the United States on July 30, 2025, suspending duty-free de minimis treatment for all countries. The order cites national emergencies related to illicit drug trafficking from Canada and Mexico, as well as the synthetic opioid supply chain from the People's Republic of China. It also addresses large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits. The suspension is deemed necessary to ensure the effectiveness of tariffs imposed to address these emergencies and to prevent evasion. The order outlines specific procedures for collecting duties on international postal shipments and directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to implement and enforce these measures.",
