    "title": "Expanding Access to In Vitro Fertilization",
    "summary": "The document titled \"Executive Order 14216 of February 18, 2025\" outlines a policy aimed at expanding access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) for American families facing infertility challenges. Recognizing that approximately one in seven couples struggle to conceive, the order emphasizes the emotional and financial burdens associated with infertility. \n\nKey findings include the acknowledgment of high IVF costs, ranging from $12,000 to $25,000 per cycle, and the Administration's commitment to making IVF treatment more accessible and affordable. The order mandates that within 90 days, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy must provide recommendations to lower out-of-pocket costs and eliminate unnecessary regulatory barriers to IVF access. \n\nThe implications of this order suggest a significant shift in public policy towards supporting family formation, reflecting a broader commitment to enhancing reproductive health services. It also clarifies that the order does not create enforceable rights against the government, ensuring that its implementation aligns with existing laws and budgetary constraints.",
