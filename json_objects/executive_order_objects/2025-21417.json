    "summary": "Executive Order 14361, issued on November 20, 2025, modifies the scope of tariffs previously imposed on the Government of Brazil by Executive Order 14323. The initial order, dated July 30, 2025, imposed a 40 percent ad valorem duty on certain Brazilian articles due to threats to U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economy. Following negotiations with Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and based on recommendations from officials monitoring the situation, certain agricultural products have been removed from the list of items subject to the additional duty. This modification, effective November 13, 2025, is intended to address the national emergency declared in the prior order. The Secretary of State is tasked with continuing to monitor the situation and consult with relevant officials, while also being directed, in consultation with other secretaries and representatives, to implement the order.",
