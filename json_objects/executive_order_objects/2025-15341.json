    "summary": "The document is an executive order titled 'Guaranteeing Fair Banking for All Americans,' issued on August 7, 2025. It addresses concerns about financial institutions restricting access to services based on political or religious beliefs, or lawful business activities. The order highlights past practices, such as Operation Chokepoint, which targeted individuals and businesses engaged in lawful activities. The policy aims to ensure that banking decisions are based on individualized, objective, and risk-based analyses, rather than political or religious beliefs. Key actions include removing reputation risk and other considerations that could lead to politicized or unlawful debanking from regulatory guidance, identifying and reinstating affected clients, and developing a comprehensive strategy to combat such practices. The order also mandates reviews and potential disciplinary actions against financial institutions engaged in unlawful debanking.",
