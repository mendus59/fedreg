    "title": "Imposing Tariffs on Countries Importing Venezuelan Oil",
    "summary": "The document is Executive Order 14245, issued by President Donald J. Trump on March 24, 2025, which imposes tariffs on countries importing Venezuelan oil. This action is framed within the context of a national emergency declared regarding Venezuela, citing threats posed by the Maduro regime and the Tren de Aragua gang, a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization involved in criminal activities across the Americas.\n\nKey findings include:\n- The Maduro regime's actions, such as undermining democratic institutions, economic mismanagement, and humanitarian crises, continue to threaten U.S. national security.\n- A 25 percent tariff may be imposed on goods imported into the U.S. from any country that imports Venezuelan oil, effective April 2, 2025.\n- The Secretary of State, in consultation with other officials, will determine the imposition of these tariffs and their duration.\n- The order allows for ongoing reporting and assessment of the tariffs' effectiveness and the Maduro regime's conduct.\n\nThe implications of this order suggest a significant escalation in U.S. economic measures against Venezuela, aiming to deter countries from engaging in oil trade with the Maduro government, thereby exerting pressure on its regime and addressing national security concerns.",
