    "summary": "Executive Order 14374 establishes a second emergency board to investigate unresolved disputes between the Long Island Rail Road Company and its employees, represented by several labor organizations including the Transportation Communications Union and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen. This board is appointed under the Railway Labor Act (RLA) after a previous emergency board's recommendations were not fully accepted. The new board, effective January 16, 2026, will investigate the disputes, receive final settlement offers from the parties within 30 days of its creation, and submit a report to the President within 30 days of receiving these offers, selecting the most reasonable offer. Crucially, the order mandates that parties maintain the status quo regarding employment conditions from the time of the request until 60 days after the board's report, except by mutual agreement. The board will terminate upon submitting its report, and its records will be maintained by the National Mediation Board.",
