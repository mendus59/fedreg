    "title": "Safeguarding Venezuelan Oil Revenue for the Good of the American and Venezuelan People",
    "summary": "Executive Order 14373, issued on January 9, 2026, declares a national emergency to safeguard Venezuelan oil revenue, referred to as Foreign Government Deposit Funds. The order prohibits any attachment, judgment, or other judicial process against these funds, deeming them null and void. The key findings indicate that such judicial actions would materially harm U.S. national security and foreign policy by interfering with efforts to ensure economic and political stability in Venezuela. This stability is crucial for U.S. foreign policy objectives, including curbing illegal immigration and illicit narcotics, protecting U.S. interests from malign actors, and promoting peace and stability in the Western Hemisphere. The order asserts that these funds are sovereign property of the Venezuelan government, held by the U.S. in a custodial capacity, and not for commercial use. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to implement the order, including designating the funds and complying with disbursement instructions from the Secretary of State.",
