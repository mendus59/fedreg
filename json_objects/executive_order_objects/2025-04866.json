The purpose of this order is to further advance the U.S. government's policy aimed at restoring common sense and enhancing the potential of American citizens. \n\nKey findings include the rescission of 23 specific actions, such as:\n\n- Executive Order 13994, which focused on COVID-19 response.\n- National Security Memorandum 3, concerning revitalization of foreign policy and national security.\n- Presidential Memorandum on advancing human rights for LGBTQ+ individuals globally.\n- Executive Order 14026, which increased the minimum wage for federal contractors.\n\nThe order emphasizes that these rescissions are intended to streamline federal operations and eliminate policies deemed unnecessary or harmful. Additionally, it includes general provisions ensuring that the order does not affect the authority of executive departments or create enforceable rights against the U.S. government. \n\nOverall, this executive order reflects a significant shift in federal policy direction, aiming to reduce regulatory burdens and modify previous administrative actions.",
