    "title": "Amendment to Duties To Address the Situation at Our Southern Border",
    "summary": "The document presents Executive Order 14227, issued on March 2, 2025, which amends previous orders regarding duties aimed at addressing issues at the southern border of the United States. The key amendment involves the revision of section 2(g) to allow for duty-free de minimis treatment for certain eligible articles, which will cease when the Secretary of Commerce notifies the President that appropriate systems for tariff revenue collection are in place. \n\nThe order emphasizes that it does not impair the authority of executive departments or agencies and is subject to applicable laws and budgetary considerations. Additionally, it clarifies that the order does not create enforceable rights or benefits for any party against the United States or its agencies. \n\nOverall, this executive order reflects ongoing efforts to manage border-related economic policies while balancing regulatory frameworks.",
