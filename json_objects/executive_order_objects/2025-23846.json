    "title": "Increasing Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research",
    "summary": "Executive Order 14370, issued on December 18, 2025, aims to enhance research into medical marijuana and cannabidiol (CBD). The order acknowledges the scientific support for marijuana's use in treating anorexia, nausea, and pain, noting that chronic pain affects a significant portion of the US adult and senior population. Despite 40 states having medical marijuana programs, federal policies have historically hindered research on its medical benefits. The order highlights a recommendation from HHS to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), a move supported by the FDA and the National Institute on Drug Abuse, based on findings of accepted medical use and a lower potential for abuse compared to Schedule I drugs. This rescheduling is intended to facilitate research, provide better guidance for doctors and patients, and address the current lack of adequate information, which can lead to risks like drug interactions, especially for seniors. The order also addresses hemp-derived cannabinoid products, recognizing their potential benefits and the need for a clearer regulatory framework, including guidance on THC limits. The policy prioritizes research using real-world evidence to assess health outcomes and long-term effects, particularly in vulnerable populations. Key actions include expediting the rescheduling process for marijuana and working with Congress to update the definition of hemp-derived cannabinoid products to ensure access while mitigating health risks.",
