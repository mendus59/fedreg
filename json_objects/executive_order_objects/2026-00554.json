    "summary": "Executive Order 14372, \"Prioritizing the Warfighter in Defense Contracting,\" issued on January 7, 2026, mandates that major defense contractors cease stock buy-backs and dividend payments until they can consistently produce superior products on time and within budget. The order aims to realign defense industry priorities from investor returns to warfighter needs and national security. The Secretary of War is tasked with identifying underperforming contractors and engaging them to resolve issues, with potential enforcement actions including utilizing the Defense Production Act and Federal Acquisition Regulations. Future contracts will prohibit stock buy-backs and dividends during periods of underperformance, and executive compensation will be linked to delivery and production metrics rather than short-term financial gains. The order also directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to consider regulations restricting safe harbors for stock buy-backs by defense contractors.",
