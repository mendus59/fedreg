    "summary": "The document is an executive order issued by the President on July 7, 2025, titled \"Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign-Controlled Energy Sources.\" The order aims to eliminate federal subsidies for wind and solar energy, citing their unreliability, high costs, and dependence on foreign supply chains. It directs the Department of the Treasury to enforce the termination of tax credits for wind and solar facilities and to implement enhanced restrictions on foreign entities of concern. The Department of the Interior is tasked with reviewing and revising regulations to eliminate preferential treatment for wind and solar facilities. The order also requires reports from the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of the Interior within 45 days, outlining findings and actions taken to implement the order.",
