    "title": "Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies",
    "summary": "The document is Executive Order 14215, issued by the President on February 18, 2025, aimed at ensuring accountability for all federal agencies. It emphasizes the President's constitutional role in overseeing executive power and aims to increase accountability of independent regulatory agencies, which have previously operated with minimal presidential oversight.\n\nKey points include:\n\n1. **Policy and Purpose**: The order stresses the need for presidential supervision of executive branch officials to maintain accountability to the American people, addressing concerns that independent regulatory agencies exercise significant authority without adequate oversight.\n\n2. **Regulatory Review**: All executive departments and independent agencies must submit significant regulatory actions for review to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) before they are published, ensuring that the President can oversee these actions.\n\n3. **Performance Standards**: The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will establish performance standards for independent agency heads and report on their efficiency.\n\n4. **Consultation Requirements**: Independent regulatory agencies are required to regularly consult with OMB and other White House councils, and establish a White House Liaison position to facilitate communication.\n\n5. **Interpretation of Law**: The President and Attorney General will provide authoritative legal interpretations for executive branch employees, ensuring a unified legal stance.\n\n6. **General Provisions**: The order outlines that if any part is deemed invalid, the remainder will still stand and clarifies that it does not create enforceable rights against the U.S. government.\n\nOverall, this Executive Order seeks to enhance the accountability of federal agencies to the President and, by extension, to the public, thereby promoting a more unified execution of federal law.",
