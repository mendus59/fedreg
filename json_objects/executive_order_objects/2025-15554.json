    "title": "Further Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates To Reflect Ongoing Discussions With the People's Republic of China",
    "summary": "Executive Order 14334, issued on August 11, 2025, extends the suspension of additional ad valorem duties on imports from the People's Republic of China (PRC) until November 10, 2025. This decision is based on ongoing discussions with the PRC to address trade reciprocity and national security concerns. The order modifies the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) and directs various government agencies to implement these changes. The suspension aims to encourage the PRC to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements and address U.S. economic and national security concerns. The order also outlines the authority and responsibilities of different departments and agencies in enforcing these measures.",
