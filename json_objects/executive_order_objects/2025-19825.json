    "title": "Modifying Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People's Republic of China",
    "summary": "Executive Order 14357 modifies previous duties imposed on goods from the People's Republic of China (PRC) to address the synthetic opioid supply chain. Previously, duties were raised to 20% due to the PRC's failure to adequately address the illicit drug crisis. Following discussions and commitments from the PRC to halt fentanyl shipments and control chemical exports, the United States has agreed to reduce the additional ad valorem duty rate from 20% to 10%, effective November 10, 2025. The Secretary of Homeland Security is directed to implement these changes and monitor the PRC's adherence to its commitments, with the possibility of modifying the order if the PRC fails to implement its promises.",
