The order also clarifies that these days will be treated as holidays for the purpose of employee pay and leave, consistent with existing statutes and Executive Order 11582. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management is tasked with implementing the order, which is subject to applicable law and appropriations, and does not create new legal rights or benefits.",
