    "title": "Ensuring American Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Resilience by Filling the Strategic Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Reserve",
    "summary": "Executive Order 14336, issued on August 13, 2025, aims to ensure the resilience of the American pharmaceutical supply chain by filling the Strategic Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Reserve (SAPIR). The order highlights that while nearly 40% of prescription finished drug products are made in the U.S., only about 10% of the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) by volume are domestically produced. The order directs the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) to develop a list of approximately 26 critical drugs and to obtain a 6-month supply of APIs for these drugs, with a preference for domestically manufactured APIs. The order also mandates a plan to open a second SAPIR repository within a year and ensures that the implementation of the order is consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.",
