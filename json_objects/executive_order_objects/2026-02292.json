This event will be the first INDYCAR motor race held in the nation's capital, with drivers navigating a route around national monuments. The order directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Transportation to designate a suitable race route within 14 days and expedite all necessary permits and approvals. The Secretary of Transportation is also tasked with using available funds to facilitate the race and, in coordination with the FAA, ensuring the use of unmanned aircraft systems for enhanced public enjoyment and to showcase the capital's beauty, provided it does not compromise government facilities. The Secretaries, in coordination with the Mayor of Washington, D.C., will also ensure the maintenance of roads, trails, and bridges used for the race course. The order emphasizes that its implementation is subject to applicable law and the availability of appropriations.",
