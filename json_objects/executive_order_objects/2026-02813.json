    "title": "Addressing Threats to the United States by the Government of Iran",
    "summary": "Executive Order 14382, issued on February 6, 2026, addresses threats to the United States posed by the Government of Iran. It reaffirms the national emergency declared in previous executive orders, citing Iran's actions and policies as an unusual and extraordinary threat to U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economy. To counter this threat, the order imposes an additional ad valorem duty on imports of goods from countries that directly or indirectly purchase, import, or acquire goods or services from Iran. The Secretary of Commerce is tasked with identifying such countries, and the Secretary of State, in consultation with other officials, will determine the extent of the duty. The order grants authority to modify its provisions based on new information, foreign retaliation, or significant steps taken by Iran or affected countries to address the national emergency. It also establishes mechanisms for monitoring and recommending further actions.",
