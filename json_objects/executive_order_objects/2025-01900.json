    "title": "Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government",
    "summary": "The document outlines Executive Order 14147, issued on January 20, 2025, aimed at addressing and ending the alleged weaponization of the federal government against political opponents by the previous administration. It describes a systematic campaign using federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to target individuals based on their political views, including investigations and prosecutions that appeared politically motivated rather than justifiable under the law.\n\nKey findings include:\n- The prior administration's actions are characterized as a misuse of prosecutorial power, affecting citizens exercising their constitutional rights.\n- A review process is mandated for federal agencies to identify any misconduct over the last four years, with reports and recommendations for remedial actions to be submitted to the President.\n- The order emphasizes compliance with document-retention policies and legal obligations, with noncompliance referred to the Attorney General.\n\nThe implications of this executive order suggest a shift towards accountability in federal law enforcement practices and a commitment to uphold constitutional rights, signaling a potential reevaluation of past governmental conduct.",
