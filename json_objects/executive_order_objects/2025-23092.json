    "title": "Ensuring a National Policy Framework for Artificial Intelligence",
    "summary": "Executive Order 14365, issued by the President on December 11, 2025, establishes a national policy framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) aimed at maintaining U.S. global AI dominance. The order revokes previous attempts to hinder AI leadership and directs the administration to remove barriers to AI innovation. It criticizes state-by-state AI regulations for creating a complex patchwork, potentially forcing ideological bias into AI models, and impinging on interstate commerce. The policy advocates for a minimally burdensome national standard that protects children, prevents censorship, respects copyrights, and safeguards communities. To implement this, the order establishes an AI Litigation Task Force to challenge inconsistent state AI laws, directs the Secretary of Commerce to evaluate state AI laws and identify onerous ones, and restricts certain state funding for states with conflicting AI laws. It also initiates proceedings for a federal reporting and disclosure standard for AI models and clarifies the FTC Act's preemption of state laws mandating deceptive AI conduct. Finally, it calls for legislative recommendations for a uniform federal AI policy framework, while exempting certain state AI laws related to child safety, infrastructure, and government procurement.",
