    "title": "Ending Procurement and Forced Use of Paper Straws",
    "summary": "The document presents Executive Order 14208, issued on February 10, 2025, which mandates the cessation of procurement and forced use of paper straws by the federal government. The order criticizes the movement against plastic straws, stating that paper straws are often less functional, more expensive, and can potentially pose health risks due to chemical use. It instructs federal agencies to eliminate the purchase and provision of paper straws, reversing policies that favored them over plastic straws. A National Strategy to End the Use of Paper Straws is to be developed within 45 days, addressing policies that penalize plastic straws and outlining other measures for nationwide implementation. The order emphasizes that it does not create enforceable rights against the government.",
