    "title": "Addressing Threats to the United States by the Government of Cuba",
    "summary": "Executive Order 14380, issued on January 29, 2026, declares a national emergency due to the Government of Cuba's actions, which are deemed a threat to U.S. national security and foreign policy. The order cites Cuba's alignment with hostile nations and terrorist groups, its hosting of foreign intelligence facilities, and its support for adversaries in the Western Hemisphere. It also condemns Cuba's human rights violations and suppression of freedoms. To address this emergency, the order establishes a tariff system imposing additional ad valorem duties on imports from countries that sell or provide oil to Cuba, directly or indirectly. The Secretary of Commerce is tasked with identifying such countries, and the Secretary of State, in consultation with other officials, will determine the imposition and extent of these tariffs. The order also includes provisions for modification based on changing circumstances, retaliation, or Cuban government actions, and outlines monitoring and reporting requirements to Congress.",
