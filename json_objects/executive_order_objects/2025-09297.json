    "title": "Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates To Reflect Discussions With the People's Republic of China",
    "summary": "Executive Order 14298, issued on May 12, 2025, modifies reciprocal tariff rates in response to trade discussions with the People's Republic of China (PRC). The order stems from a national emergency declared due to significant U.S. goods trade deficits, prompting the imposition of additional ad valorem duties on imports from the PRC. \n\nKey points include:\n\n1. **Background**: Previous executive orders (14257, 14259, and 14266) established tariffs in reaction to PRC's trade practices and retaliatory measures. The latest order reflects ongoing discussions aimed at improving trade reciprocity.\n\n2. **Tariff Modifications**: Effective May 14, 2025, an additional ad valorem duty of 10% will be applied to goods imported from the PRC, with certain exceptions. This marks a temporary suspension of previously higher duty rates.\n\n3. **Implementation**: The order directs various government departments to implement these changes, ensuring compliance with U.S. law while addressing national security and economic concerns.\n\n4. **General Provisions**: The order clarifies that it does not create enforceable rights for individuals against the U.S. government and outlines the responsibilities for publication costs.\n\nOverall, the executive order signals a strategic adjustment in U.S. trade policy aimed at fostering improved economic relations with China while addressing national security concerns related to trade imbalances.",
