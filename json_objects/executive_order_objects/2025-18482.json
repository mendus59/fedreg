    "title": "Further Extending the TikTok Enforcement Delay",
    "summary": "The document is an executive order (14350) issued on September 16, 2025, further extending the enforcement delay of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, specifically targeting TikTok. The enforcement delay is extended until December 16, 2025, during which the Department of Justice will not take any action against entities for noncompliance with the Act. The Attorney General is directed to issue guidance and letters to providers, stating no violations or liability for conduct during the specified period. The order also asserts the federal government's exclusive authority to enforce the Act, preventing state or private enforcement. The order is implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to available appropriations, and it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits.",
