    "title": "Council To Assess the Federal Emergency Management Agency",
    "summary": "The document is an Executive Order issued on January 24, 2025, establishing the Federal Emergency Management Agency Review Council. The order highlights the need for a comprehensive assessment of FEMA's effectiveness following recent disasters, particularly Hurricane Helene. It expresses concerns about FEMA's response capabilities, political biases, and misallocation of resources, emphasizing that vulnerable Americans have not received adequate support despite significant disaster aid funding.\n\nThe Council, comprising up to 20 members including key government officials and external experts, is tasked with advising the President on improving FEMA's operations. It will evaluate FEMA's disaster response over the past four years, compare its effectiveness with state and local responses, and explore historical contexts for disaster relief efforts.\n\nThe Council is required to solicit public input and is expected to hold its first meeting within 90 days, with a report due within 180 days of that meeting. The order stipulates that the Council will terminate one year after its establishment unless extended by the President. Overall, the initiative aims to enhance FEMA's impartiality and efficiency in disaster management, ensuring a more effective federal response to emergencies.",
