    "summary": "The document is a Presidential Permit issued on June 13, 2025, authorizing the City of Laredo, Texas, to expand and maintain a vehicular border crossing at the Laredo-Colombia Solidarity International Bridge. The permit outlines the conditions for construction, operation, and maintenance of the border facilities, including the addition of two new 4-lane spans for commercial traffic.\n\nKey conditions include compliance with federal, state, and local laws, the need for environmental impact mitigation, and the requirement for inspections by authorized agencies. The permittee must also notify the President of any changes in control or ownership and is responsible for obtaining necessary permits prior to construction.\n\nThe permit will expire if construction has not commenced within five years. It does not create enforceable rights against the United States. The implications of this permit highlight the federal government's role in regulating cross-border infrastructure and ensuring compliance with environmental and safety standards.",
