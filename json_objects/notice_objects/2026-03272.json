    "title": "Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Cuba and of the Emergency Authority Relating to the Regulation of the Anchorage and Movement of Vessels",
    "summary": "The Presidential Documents notice of February 13, 2026, announces the continuation of the national emergency concerning Cuba and the emergency authority for regulating vessel movement. This emergency, initially declared on March 1, 1996, due to the destruction of U.S. aircraft by Cuba, has been expanded and modified over the years. The continuation is based on the Cuban government's continued potential for excessive force against U.S. vessels and the detrimental impact of unauthorized U.S.-registered vessel entry into Cuban waters, which could lead to mass migration endangering U.S. national security. The notice cites Proclamations 6867, 7757, 9398, and 9699 as the basis for this ongoing emergency declaration.",
