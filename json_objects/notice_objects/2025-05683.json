    "summary": "The document titled \"Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to South Sudan\" outlines the decision made by the President on March 28, 2025, to extend the national emergency originally declared on April 3, 2014, through Executive Order 13664. This extension is due to the ongoing unusual and extraordinary threat posed by the situation in South Sudan, characterized by widespread violence, human rights abuses, and destabilizing activities that threaten both the region and U.S. national security.\n\nThe continuation of this national emergency reflects the persistent challenges in South Sudan, including the recruitment of child soldiers, attacks on peacekeepers, and obstruction of humanitarian efforts. The President's decision ensures that measures under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act remain in effect for another year, highlighting the U.S. commitment to addressing the crisis in South Sudan.\n\nThis notice will be published in the Federal Register and communicated to Congress, indicating the government's transparency and the importance of legislative awareness regarding this ongoing situation.",
