    "title": "Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Cuba and of the Emergency Authority Relating to the Regulation of the Anchorage and Movement of Vessels",
    "summary": "The document titled \"Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Cuba\" outlines the extension of a national emergency initially declared in 1996 due to threats to U.S. international relations stemming from actions by the Cuban government. This emergency has been modified several times, most recently on February 20, 2025, highlighting ongoing concerns over excessive force by Cuba against U.S. vessels and aircraft, as well as the potential for unauthorized U.S. vessels entering Cuban waters, which could lead to mass migration and jeopardize U.S. national security.\n\nThe President has determined that the situation warrants the continuation of the national emergency and associated regulatory authority concerning the movement of vessels. This decision is based on the persistent threat to international relations and national security posed by the Cuban government's actions. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and communicated to Congress, reinforcing the U.S. government's stance on maintaining strict regulations related to Cuba.",
