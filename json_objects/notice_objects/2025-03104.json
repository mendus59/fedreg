    "summary": "The document titled \"Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Libya\" details the U.S. government's decision to extend the national emergency initially declared on February 25, 2011, under Executive Order 13566. This emergency was established in response to threats posed by Colonel Muammar Qadhafi and his regime, which included severe violence against civilians and potential misappropriation of Libyan state assets.\n\nThe President's notice highlights that the situation in Libya remains a significant threat to U.S. national security and foreign policy due to ongoing violence, human rights abuses, and destabilization efforts by armed groups. The national emergency, which was expanded in 2016 under Executive Order 13726, is deemed necessary to protect against asset diversion and abuses by Qadhafi's associates, hindering Libya's national reconciliation process.\n\nThe emergency will continue for another year, reaffirming the U.S. commitment to addressing the challenges in Libya and ensuring the protection of its interests. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and communicated to Congress.",
