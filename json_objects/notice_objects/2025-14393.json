    "title": "Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Lebanon",
    "summary": "The document is a notice from the White House, dated July 25, 2025, announcing the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Lebanon, originally declared on August 1, 2007. The emergency was declared due to actions undermining Lebanon's democratic institutions, contributing to political and economic instability, and threatening U.S. national security and foreign policy. Ongoing activities, such as Iran's arms transfers to Hizballah, continue to pose an extraordinary threat. Therefore, the national emergency is extended for another year beyond August 1, 2025. The notice is to be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.",
