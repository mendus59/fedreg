    "summary": "The document titled \"Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Situation in and in Relation to Burma\" outlines the decision to extend a national emergency declared by the President on February 10, 2021. This emergency was enacted due to the significant threat to U.S. national security and foreign policy stemming from the military coup in Burma on February 1, 2021, which overthrew the democratically elected government and led to the detention of political leaders and activists. The continuation of this national emergency is deemed necessary as the situation in Burma remains a serious concern. The national emergency will now remain in effect for an additional year beyond February 10, 2025. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and communicated to Congress, indicating ongoing U.S. commitment to addressing the crisis in Burma.",
