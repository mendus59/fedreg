    "summary": "The document titled \"Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Actions of the Government of Syria\" outlines the decision made by the President on May 7, 2025, to extend the national emergency initially declared on May 11, 2004, due to ongoing threats posed by the Syrian government. The emergency stems from Syria's support for terrorism, its occupation of Lebanon, and its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, which continue to threaten U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economy.\n\nThe President's action is based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act. The continuation of the emergency will remain in effect for one year beyond May 11, 2025, with future policy changes by Syria being considered for any potential termination of the emergency.\n\nThis decision emphasizes the U.S. commitment to addressing the threats from Syria and indicates that the situation remains serious enough to warrant ongoing scrutiny and action. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and communicated to Congress.",
