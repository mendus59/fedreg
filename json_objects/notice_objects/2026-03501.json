    "title": "Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Ukraine",
    "summary": "The Presidential Documents section of the Federal Register, dated February 20, 2026, announces the continuation of the national emergency concerning Ukraine. This emergency, initially declared on March 6, 2014, by Executive Order 13660, addresses the threat posed by actions undermining Ukraine's democratic processes, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, as well as asset misappropriation. Subsequent executive orders in 2014 and 2022 expanded the scope of this emergency, particularly in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea and its actions in eastern Ukraine. The notice explicitly states that these ongoing actions and policies continue to constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, necessitating the continuation of the national emergency for another year beyond March 6, 2026, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act.",
