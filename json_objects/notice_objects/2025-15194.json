The emergency addresses the threat posed by countries of concern advancing sensitive technologies and products critical for military, intelligence, surveillance, or cyber-enabled capabilities. The notice highlights that ongoing activities and strategies by these countries enhance their ability to threaten U.S. national security, and that certain U.S. outbound investments risk exacerbating this threat. As a result, the national emergency is extended for one year beyond August 9, 2025. The notice is published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.",
