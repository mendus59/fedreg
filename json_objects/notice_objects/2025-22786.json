    "title": "Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Global Illicit Drug Trade",
    "summary": "The Presidential Documents notice of December 10, 2025, announces the continuation of the national emergency concerning global illicit drug trade, originally declared on December 15, 2021, via Executive Order 14059. This emergency is extended for one year, as the illicit drug trafficking, particularly of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, continues to pose a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The document highlights that this trade causes tens of thousands of American deaths annually and fuels violence, with drug cartels and transnational criminal organizations being the primary sources. The growing role of internet-based drug sales is also noted as a contributing factor to the ongoing threat.",
