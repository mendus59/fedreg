    "title": "Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Iran",
    "summary": "The Notice of November 5, 2025, published in the Federal Register, announces the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Iran. This emergency was initially declared on November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, due to an unusual and extraordinary threat to the U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economy. The notice states that because relations with Iran have not normalized and the implementation of agreements dated January 19, 1981, is ongoing, the emergency and related measures must remain in effect beyond November 14, 2025. Consequently, the national emergency is continued for one year. This renewal is distinct from the emergency declared in Executive Order 12957 on March 15, 1995, and its subsequent renewal on March 7, 2025.",
