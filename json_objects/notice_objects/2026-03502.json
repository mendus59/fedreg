    "title": "Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Venezuela",
    "summary": "On February 18, 2026, the President issued a notice continuing the national emergency with respect to Venezuela, originally declared on March 8, 2015, via Executive Order 13692. This emergency was declared due to the Venezuelan government's erosion of human rights, persecution of political opponents, curtailment of press freedoms, use of violence against protesters, arbitrary arrests, and significant government corruption. Subsequent Executive Orders in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2025 further addressed the situation. The notice states that these circumstances continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, thus warranting the continuation of the national emergency for another year.",
