    "title": "Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Western Balkans",
    "summary": "The document outlines the continuation of a national emergency concerning the Western Balkans, initially declared by Executive Order 13219 on June 26, 2001. The emergency was established due to threats to U.S. national security and foreign policy stemming from extremist violence and obstruction of peace agreements in the region. Subsequent amendments and expansions were made through Executive Orders 13304, 14033, and 14140, which addressed ongoing issues such as corruption, challenges to sovereignty, and violations of governance principles.\n\nThe President has determined that these threats persist, warranting the extension of the national emergency for another year beyond June 26, 2025. This decision is based on the continued instability and challenges to democratic governance in the Western Balkans, which hinder integration into transatlantic institutions. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and communicated to Congress, emphasizing the ongoing commitment to addressing the complexities in the region.",
