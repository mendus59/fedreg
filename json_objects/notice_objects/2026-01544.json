    "title": "Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the International Criminal Court",
    "summary": "Presidential Documents, specifically a Notice dated January 20, 2026, announces the continuation of a national emergency concerning the International Criminal Court (ICC). This emergency, initially declared on February 6, 2025, under Executive Order 14203, addresses the \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" posed by the ICC's actions against protected persons, including U.S. and Israeli personnel. The notice asserts that the ICC has illegitimately targeted the U.S. and its ally Israel, asserting jurisdiction without basis and issuing baseless arrest warrants. It emphasizes that neither the U.S. nor Israel are parties to the Rome Statute or members of the ICC, and that the ICC's actions endanger U.S. personnel and undermine national security and foreign policy. Consequently, the national emergency is extended for another year, as per the National Emergencies Act.",
