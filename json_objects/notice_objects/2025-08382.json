    "summary": "The document titled \"Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Yemen\" outlines the decision made by the President on May 7, 2025, to extend the national emergency initially declared on May 16, 2012, under Executive Order 13611. This emergency was established due to the actions of certain Yemeni government officials and groups, particularly the Houthis (Ansar Allah), which threaten Yemen's peace, security, and stability, thereby posing a significant risk to U.S. national security and foreign policy.\n\nThe continuation of this national emergency is deemed necessary as the ongoing actions of the Houthis continue to obstruct political processes and undermine stability in Yemen. The emergency will remain in effect for another year, emphasizing the U.S. government's commitment to addressing the threats arising from the situation in Yemen. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and communicated to Congress, reflecting the formal procedures required for such declarations.",
