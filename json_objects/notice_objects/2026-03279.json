    "title": "Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Libya",
    "summary": "The notice from February 13, 2026, announces the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Libya, originally declared on February 25, 2011, and expanded on April 19, 2016. The emergency was initially declared due to the extreme measures taken by Colonel Muammar Qadhafi and his associates against the Libyan people, posing a threat to national security and foreign policy. The scope was later expanded to include ongoing violence, human rights abuses, violations of the arms embargo, and misappropriation of Libya's natural resources, which threaten the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, democratic transition, and territorial integrity of Libya. The President has determined that the situation continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States and that measures are needed to prevent asset diversion and abuses by those hindering Libyan national reconciliation. Therefore, the national emergency is continued for one year beyond February 25, 2026.",
