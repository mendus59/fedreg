    "title": "Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Venezuela",
    "summary": "The document announces the continuation of the national emergency declared by the President on March 8, 2015, regarding the situation in Venezuela. This emergency was initially prompted by issues such as the erosion of human rights, persecution of political opponents, suppression of press freedoms, and significant government corruption. Despite previous executive orders aimed at addressing these circumstances, the conditions in Venezuela have not improved and continue to pose a threat to U.S. national security and foreign policy. As a result, the national emergency will be extended for another year, as mandated by the National Emergencies Act. This decision will be published in the Federal Register and communicated to Congress.",
