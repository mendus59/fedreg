    "summary": "The document titled \"Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Specified Harmful Foreign Activities of the Government of the Russian Federation\" outlines the decision to extend a national emergency originally declared on April 15, 2021, by Executive Order 14024. This emergency addresses significant threats posed by the Russian government, including interference in democratic elections, cyber-attacks, transnational corruption, targeting dissidents, and violations of international law.\n\nThe President has determined that these threats continue to jeopardize U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economic interests. As a result, the national emergency will remain in effect for another year beyond April 15, 2025. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and communicated to Congress, highlighting ongoing concerns about Russian activities and the need for continued vigilance and response.",
