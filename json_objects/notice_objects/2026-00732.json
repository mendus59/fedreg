    "title": "Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Energy",
    "summary": "A Notice dated January 12, 2026, from the White House announces the continuation of the national emergency concerning the United States' insufficient energy and critical minerals production, transportation, refining, and generation. This emergency, initially declared on January 20, 2025, via Executive Order 14156, is extended for another year. The notice cites the ongoing need for a reliable, diversified, and affordable energy supply to support national industries and defense. It attributes inadequate energy supply and infrastructure to past harmful policies, including those at the State and local levels, particularly in the Northeast and West Coast regions. These policies are blamed for worsening high energy prices and undermining grid reliability. The continuation of the emergency is deemed necessary to address the threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy, and to mitigate risks posed by hostile foreign actors, ensure national defense needs, foster technological innovation, and improve grid reliability.",
