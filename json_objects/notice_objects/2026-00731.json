    "summary": "A Notice from the President dated January 12, 2026, announces the continuation of national emergencies related to the southern border of the United States and cartels/transnational organizations. These emergencies, initially declared in January and February 2025, address threats posed by cartels, criminal gangs, terrorists, human traffickers, smugglers, unvetted military-age males, and illicit narcotics. The continuation also addresses the perceived failures of Canada, Mexico, and the People's Republic of China governments in controlling drug and human trafficking, illegal immigration, and precursor chemical suppliers. The national emergencies will remain in effect for another year, as per the National Emergencies Act.",
