This permit, granted by the President, covers the pedestrian and vehicular crossing at the U.S. border with Mexico in San Luis, Arizona. Key conditions include compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, mitigation of adverse environmental impacts, obtaining necessary permits, and reporting requirements. The GSA must also obtain concurrence from the International Boundary and Water Commission and diplomatic authorization from Mexico before construction. The permit is subject to Presidential review and can be amended, revoked, or terminated. It does not create any rights enforceable against the United States. The permit remains in effect as long as the authorized operations continue.",
