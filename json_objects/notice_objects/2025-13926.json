    "summary": "The document is a notice from the White House, dated July 21, 2025, regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Mali. The original emergency was declared on July 26, 2019, due to the unusual and extraordinary threat to U.S. national security and foreign policy posed by the situation in Mali. The ongoing threats include violations of ceasefire agreements, coups, terrorist activities, drug trafficking, human rights abuses, and attacks against civilians and international forces. Due to these persistent threats, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13882 is extended for another year. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.",
