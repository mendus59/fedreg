    "summary": "The document titled \"Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Somalia\" outlines the ongoing national emergency declared by the President on April 12, 2010, due to the significant threats posed by the deteriorating security situation in Somalia, including violence, piracy, and arms embargo violations. The President's Executive Order 13620 issued on July 20, 2012, further addressed issues such as the export of charcoal funding al-Shabaab and violence against civilians.\n\nAs of April 8, 2025, the President has determined that the situation in Somalia continues to represent an unusual and extraordinary threat to U.S. national security and foreign policy. Consequently, the national emergency will be extended for one year beyond April 12, 2025. This decision emphasizes the need for ongoing measures to address the persistent threats emanating from Somalia. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and communicated to Congress.",
