    "summary": "The document titled \"Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain\" announces the extension of a national emergency initially declared on May 15, 2019, by Executive Order 13873. This emergency addresses the significant threat posed to U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economy by the unrestricted acquisition and use of certain information and communications technology by foreign adversaries. The President emphasizes that this ongoing threat necessitates the continuation of the national emergency for another year, beyond May 15, 2025. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and communicated to Congress, reinforcing the government's commitment to securing the information and communications technology supply chain against potential vulnerabilities.",
