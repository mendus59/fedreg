    "title": "Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Significant Transnational Criminal Organizations",
    "summary": "The document is a notice from the White House, dated July 21, 2025, regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal organizations. The national emergency was initially declared on July 24, 2011, by Executive Order 13581, citing these organizations as an unusual and extraordinary threat to U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economy. Additional steps were taken on March 15, 2019, by Executive Order 13863, due to the evolving sophistication and threats posed by these organizations. The notice states that the threat continues to persist, necessitating the extension of the national emergency beyond July 24, 2025, for another year. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.",
