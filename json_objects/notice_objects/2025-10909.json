    "summary": "The document titled \"Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Belarus\" announces the extension of a national emergency initially declared on June 16, 2006, by Executive Order 13405. This emergency addresses threats to U.S. national security and foreign policy posed by the Belarusian government\u2019s actions, including undermining democratic processes, committing human rights abuses, and engaging in public corruption.\n\nThe emergency was expanded on August 9, 2021, by Executive Order 14038 due to ongoing harmful activities by the Belarusian regime, particularly following the fraudulent presidential election in August 2020. These activities include the suppression of democracy, elimination of political opposition, and threats to international civil air travel.\n\nThe continuation of this national emergency for another year beyond June 16, 2025, underscores the persistent and extraordinary threats posed by the Belarusian government. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and sent to Congress, reaffirming the U.S. commitment to addressing these challenges.",
