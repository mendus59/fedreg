    "title": "Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Certain Companies of the People's Republic of China",
    "summary": "On November 5, 2025, the President issued a notice continuing the national emergency declared on November 12, 2020, concerning securities investments that finance certain People's Republic of China (PRC) companies. This emergency, initially established by Executive Order 13959 and expanded by Executive Order 14032, addresses the threat posed by the PRC's Military-Civil Fusion strategy. This strategy enables the PRC to exploit U.S. capital to advance its military, intelligence, and security apparatuses, including research, development, and production of weapons. The expanded scope also covers the use of Chinese surveillance technology that facilitates repression or human rights abuses. The continuation of this national emergency is deemed necessary due to the ongoing threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.",
