    "title": "Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Foreign Interference in or Undermining Public Confidence in United States Elections",
    "summary": "The document is a notice from the White House, dated August 29, 2025, regarding the continuation of the national emergency declared on September 12, 2018, under Executive Order 13848. This emergency addresses the threat of foreign interference in U.S. elections, which is deemed an unusual and extraordinary threat to national security and foreign policy. Although there is no evidence of foreign powers altering election outcomes, the proliferation of digital devices and internet-based communications has increased vulnerabilities and magnified the threat. The ability of foreign actors to interfere in U.S. elections through unauthorized access to election infrastructure or the distribution of propaganda and disinformation continues to pose a significant risk. Therefore, the national emergency is extended for another year beyond September 12, 2025. The notice is published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.",
