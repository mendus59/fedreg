    "title": "Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Sudan",
    "summary": "The document is a notice from the White House dated October 16, 2025, regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Sudan. The national emergency was initially declared in 1997 due to the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan, which posed an unusual and extraordinary threat to U.S. national security and foreign policy. The scope of the emergency was expanded in 2006 to include the conflict in Sudan's Darfur region. Subsequent executive orders in 2017 and 2023 further modified and expanded the emergency's scope. The document states that the crisis has not been resolved and that the policies and actions of the Government of Sudan, along with the situation in Sudan and Darfur, continue to pose a significant threat. Therefore, the national emergency must continue beyond November 3, 2025. The notice is to be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.",
