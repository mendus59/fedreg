    "summary": "The document is a Presidential Determination identifying major drug transit or illicit drug-producing countries for Fiscal Year 2026. It lists 24 countries, noting that their inclusion is based on geographic, commercial, and economic factors rather than their governments' counterdrug efforts. Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, and Venezuela are specifically designated as having failed to meet their counternarcotics obligations. The document highlights the severe impact of drug trafficking on the United States, including a public health crisis and a national emergency. It outlines actions taken by the U.S. to secure its borders, cooperate with neighboring countries like Canada and Mexico, and hold accountable countries like the PRC, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Afghanistan for their roles in the drug trade. The U.S. has implemented tariffs, visa restrictions, and other measures to combat the flow of illicit drugs and precursor chemicals. The document emphasizes the need for sustained international cooperation and action to address the global drug crisis.",
