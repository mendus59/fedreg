    "summary": "The document titled \"Presidential Determination No. 202504\" outlines a determination made by the President on May 12, 2025, regarding the supply of petroleum and petroleum products. It asserts that there is an adequate supply from countries other than Iran, allowing for a significant reduction in purchases from Iran by foreign financial institutions. This conclusion is based on reports from the Energy Information Administration and various global economic factors. The Secretary of State is tasked with publishing this determination in the Federal Register. The implication of this determination suggests a strategic shift in U.S. energy procurement, potentially impacting relations with Iran and global oil markets. The President will continue to monitor the situation closely.",
