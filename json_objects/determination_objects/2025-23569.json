    "title": "Presidential Determination With Respect to the Efforts of Foreign Governments Regarding Trafficking in Persons",
    "summary": "This Presidential Determination, issued under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, outlines restrictions and waivers on U.S. foreign assistance for Fiscal Year 2026 based on foreign governments' efforts to combat human trafficking. Key findings include the withholding of nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related assistance to Afghanistan, Chad, Iran, South Sudan, and Venezuela until they comply with minimum standards. Similar restrictions, including a ban on participation in educational and cultural exchange programs for officials, apply to Belarus, Burma, China, Cuba, North Korea, Eritrea, Macau, Nicaragua, and Russia. The U.S. will also vote against loans from multilateral development banks for these countries, with specific humanitarian, trade-related, or basic human needs exceptions. However, certain assistance programs are deemed to promote the Act's purposes or U.S. national interests for Cambodia, Laos, Papua New Guinea, Sudan, and Syria. Partial waivers are granted for educational and cultural exchanges with Belarus, Eritrea, Macau, and Russia, and for Global Health Programs with South Sudan. Venezuela receives a partial waiver allowing most nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related foreign assistance, excluding certain defense-related programs. Sint Maarten faces restrictions on nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related assistance and loans, but its officials can still participate in educational and cultural exchange programs.",
