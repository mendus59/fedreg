    "summary": "Presidential Determination No. 2025-14 transfers the administration of the United States Program of Initial Refugee Resettlement grants and contracts from the Department of State to the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Refugee Resettlement. This action aims to centralize responsibilities, eliminate duplication, enhance coordination with State and local jurisdictions, and ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars, early refugee self-sufficiency, and assimilation. The determination aligns with the original structure established by the Refugee Act of 1980, designating the Office of Refugee Resettlement as the lead Federal entity for domestic refugee resettlement. The Departments of State and Health and Human Services are directed to coordinate the orderly transfer of necessary resources.",
