    "title": "Regarding the Acquisition of Certain Assets of EMCORE Corporation by HieFo Corporation",
    "summary": "This Presidential Order prohibits the acquisition of certain assets of EMCORE Corporation by HieFo Corporation, a company controlled by a Chinese citizen. The order cites credible evidence that this acquisition might impair U.S. national security. HieFo is required to divest all interests and rights in the acquired assets within 180 days. Until divestment is complete, HieFo is prohibited from granting access to these assets or related non-public information to any unauthorized personnel. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is authorized to impose conditions, conduct audits, and verify compliance to mitigate national security risks. HieFo must provide weekly compliance certifications and cannot sell or transfer the assets to a third party without CFIUS approval. The Attorney General is authorized to enforce the order.",
