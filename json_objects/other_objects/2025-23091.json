    "summary": "This Presidential Permit, issued on December 10, 2025, authorizes the General Services Administration (GSA) to modernize, expand, and continue operating the San Luis I Land Port of Entry in San Luis, Arizona. The permit outlines conditions for construction, maintenance, and operation, including environmental mitigation, compliance with federal laws, and inspection by relevant agencies. It also details procedures for transferring custody and control of the border facilities, requiring Presidential approval for any transfer to non-Federal entities. The GSA must obtain necessary permits, coordinate with the International Boundary and Water Commission, and await diplomatic clearance from Mexico before commencing construction. The permit emphasizes ongoing reporting and notification requirements to the President or designee regarding the facilities' status and any changes. The President reserves the right to amend or terminate the permit at any time. This permit does not create any legally enforceable rights or benefits for any party against the United States.",
