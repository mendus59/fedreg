    "summary": "The memorandum titled \"Putting People Over Fish: Stopping Radical Environmentalism To Provide Water to Southern California,\" issued on January 20, 2025, directs the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior to resume efforts from the previous administration to increase water flow from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to Southern California. The memorandum emphasizes the urgent need for a reliable water supply, especially in light of recent destructive wildfires in the region. It criticizes previous legal actions taken by California's Governor that halted improvements to water infrastructure, which were aimed at protecting species like the Delta smelt, resulting in wasted water flowing into the ocean. The Secretaries are tasked with reporting back within 90 days on the progress and future recommendations for implementing the policies outlined in the memorandum. The document underscores the administration's priority of addressing water shortages over environmental protections that hinder water distribution.",
