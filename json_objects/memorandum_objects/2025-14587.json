    "title": "Revoking PPD-6 on U.S. Global Development Policy",
    "summary": "The document is a presidential memorandum dated July 15, 2025, revoking Presidential Policy Directive 6 (PPD6) on U.S. Global Development Policy. The memorandum states that PPD6 is inconsistent with recent executive actions and views on U.S. foreign assistance and international coordination. It lists several executive orders with which PPD6 is deemed inconsistent, including those related to international rescisions, America First policies, withdrawal from the World Health Organization, environmental agreements, and foreign aid realignment. The Secretary of State is directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register. The document reflects a significant shift in U.S. global development policy, emphasizing a more insular and less coordinated approach with international organizations.",
