    "title": "Limiting Lame-Duck Collective Bargaining Agreements That Improperly Attempt To Constrain the New President",
    "summary": "The document is a memorandum issued by the President on January 31, 2025, addressing the issue of collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) finalized in the last 30 days of a prior administration. The memorandum outlines a policy aimed at preventing such agreements from binding the new administration to potentially detrimental policies established by its predecessor. It asserts that these last-minute CBAs undermine democratic governance and the President's authority to manage the executive branch.\n\nKey provisions include:\n\n1. **Prohibition on New CBAs**: No new CBAs can be made in the 30 days prior to a presidential transition that create new obligations, alter existing agreements, or extend their duration.\n2. **Exemption for Law Enforcement**: The restrictions do not apply to CBAs covering law enforcement officers.\n3. **Implementation and Enforcement**: Agency heads are instructed to disapprove any agreements that violate these rules before the new administration takes office.\n\nThe memorandum emphasizes the importance of preserving the incoming administration's ability to govern effectively, reflecting a commitment to democratic principles and efficient governance.",
