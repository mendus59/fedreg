    "summary": "The document titled \"Federal Recognition of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina\" outlines a memorandum issued on January 23, 2025, which calls for the full federal recognition of the Lumbee Tribe. The Lumbee, with over 55,000 members, is the largest tribe east of the Mississippi River and has a rich history tied to various tribal nations. Although recognized by North Carolina in 1885 and by the federal government in 1956, the Lumbee have not received federal benefits associated with this recognition.\n\nThe memorandum notes that the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Lumbee Fairness Act in 2024, which would grant the tribe full federal recognition, but the Senate did not consider it. The document establishes the U.S. government's policy to support the Lumbee Tribe's full federal recognition and directs the Secretary of the Interior to develop a plan within 90 days to achieve this. This plan should explore all legal pathways for recognition, including congressional action or judicial means.\n\nKey implications of the memorandum include a commitment to rectify the historical oversight regarding the Lumbee Tribe's federal status and to ensure they can access federal benefits. It highlights the importance of tribal sovereignty and the ongoing need for legislative action to support Indigenous communities.",
