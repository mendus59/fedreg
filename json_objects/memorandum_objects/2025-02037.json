    "title": "Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture",
    "summary": "The document is a memorandum from January 20, 2025, directing the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) to propose recommendations for promoting visually identifiable Federal public buildings that reflect civic architecture and respect regional, traditional, and classical styles. The aim is to enhance public spaces and reinforce the values of self-government. The GSA is tasked with submitting these recommendations within 60 days, considering revisions to existing architectural guidelines and incorporating community input in design processes. Additionally, if the GSA intends to approve a design that deviates from this policy, it must notify the President 30 days in advance, explaining the rationale for such approval. This initiative underscores a commitment to beautifying Federal architecture and engaging the community in design decisions.",
