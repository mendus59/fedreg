    "title": "Hiring Freeze",
    "summary": "The document titled \"2025-01905.pdf\" outlines a memorandum issued on January 20, 2025, by the President, instituting a hiring freeze for Federal civilian employees across the executive branch. Key points include:\n\n- The freeze applies to all vacant positions as of noon on January 20, 2025, and prohibits the creation of new positions unless specified exceptions are met.\n- Exemptions are allowed for military personnel, immigration enforcement, national security, and public safety roles, as well as for Social Security, Medicare, and Veterans benefits.\n- The Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) can grant necessary exemptions.\n- A plan to reduce the Federal workforce through efficiency and attrition is to be submitted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) within 90 days, after which the memorandum will expire for most agencies, except the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n- Contracting to bypass the hiring freeze is prohibited, and departments must use existing personnel and resources efficiently.\n- The memorandum does not affect the nomination of officials requiring Presidential appointment or Senate confirmation, nor does it limit hiring that conflicts with existing laws or collective bargaining agreements.\n\nOverall, the memorandum emphasizes fiscal restraint and efficiency in Federal employment while allowing for flexibility in critical areas.",
