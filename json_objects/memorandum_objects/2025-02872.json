    "summary": "The memorandum titled \"Reciprocal Trade and Tariffs,\" issued on February 13, 2025, addresses the United States' trade deficit and the need for more reciprocal trade relationships. It emphasizes that the U.S. has one of the most open economies globally but is often treated unfairly by trading partners, leading to a significant trade deficit. The memorandum outlines a policy aimed at reducing this deficit by introducing the Fair and Reciprocal Plan, which will assess and counter non-reciprocal trading arrangements.\n\nKey findings include:\n- The U.S. economy suffers from unfair practices and limited access to foreign markets, harming American workers and industries.\n- The trade deficit threatens economic and national security, necessitating a shift towards more balanced trade relations.\n- The Plan will involve evaluating tariffs, taxes, and non-tariff barriers imposed by trading partners and proposing remedies to ensure fair competition.\n\nImplications of this policy include a potential shift in U.S. trade strategy, focusing on fairness and reciprocity, which may lead to changes in international trade dynamics and impact relationships with various trading partners.",
