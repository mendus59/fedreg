    "title": "Delivering Emergency Price Relief for American Families and Defeating the Cost-of-Living Crisis",
    "summary": "The document is a memorandum issued on January 20, 2025, addressing the need for emergency price relief for American families amid a cost-of-living crisis attributed to the Biden Administration's policies. It criticizes these policies for causing historic inflation, increased government spending, and regulatory burdens that have driven up the costs of essential goods and services. Key points include:\n\n- The impact of regulatory demands on American energy has raised transportation and manufacturing costs.\n- Unlawful mandates on gas-powered vehicles have artificially inflated their prices to support less popular electric vehicles.\n- High home prices are partly due to regulatory requirements that significantly increase construction costs.\n- The memorandum estimates that regulatory burdens have imposed nearly $50,000 in additional costs on the average household, contrasting with a previous agenda that reduced costs by about $11,000.\n\nThe memorandum instructs executive departments and agencies to take immediate actions to lower housing costs, reduce healthcare expenses, eliminate unnecessary appliance regulations, create job opportunities, and remove harmful climate policies. The Assistant to the President for Economic Policy is tasked with reporting on the implementation status every 30 days. The overarching goal is to restore purchasing power and improve the quality of life for American families.",
