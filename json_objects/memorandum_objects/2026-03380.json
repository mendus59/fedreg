This waiver applies to supply chains vital for reviving the defense industrial base, including those for aircraft, chemical/biological/radiological/nuclear threat protection, ground systems, nuclear warheads, radar and electronic warfare systems, shipbuilding, soldier systems, space systems, defense electronics, machine tools, the organic industrial base, and workforce training. The memorandum emphasizes that a robust domestic industrial base is crucial for national security and critical infrastructure preservation.",
