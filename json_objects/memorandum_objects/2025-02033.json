    "title": "Memorandum To Resolve the Backlog of Security Clearances for Executive Office of the President Personnel",
    "summary": "The document is a memorandum issued on January 20, 2025, addressing the backlog of security clearances for personnel in the Executive Office of the President. It highlights that the backlog, attributed to the Biden Administration, has hindered qualified individuals from accessing necessary facilities and performing their duties. \n\nTo resolve this issue, the President orders the White House Counsel to provide a list of personnel who will receive interim Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) clearances for up to six months, granting them immediate access to required resources. The White House Counsel is also empowered to supplement this list and revoke clearances as needed.\n\nThe memorandum clarifies that it does not create any enforceable rights against the United States or its entities. The implications of this action are significant, as it aims to streamline access for personnel essential to the functioning of the Executive Office, thereby enhancing operational efficiency.",
