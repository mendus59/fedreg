    "title": "Partial Revocation of Executive Order 13961",
    "summary": "The document is an Executive Order (14146) issued on January 19, 2025, which revokes specific sections of Executive Order 13961 concerning the governance and integration of federal mission resilience. Specifically, Sections 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7 of the previous order are revoked, while Sections 2, 6, and 8 are renumbered. Amendments are made to clarify language regarding the authority of the Restricted Principals Committee in relation to national continuity policy.\n\nKey provisions state that the order does not impair the authority of executive departments or agencies, nor the functions of the Office of Management and Budget. It emphasizes that the order is to be implemented in accordance with applicable law and available appropriations, and it does not create enforceable rights or benefits for any parties against the United States.\n\nThe implications of this order reflect an adjustment in federal governance related to mission resilience, potentially streamlining processes and clarifying roles within the federal structure."
