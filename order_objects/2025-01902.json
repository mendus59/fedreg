    "title": "Restoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal Censorship",
    "summary": "The document presents Executive Order 14149, signed on January 20, 2025, aimed at restoring freedom of speech and ending federal censorship in the United States. It emphasizes the importance of the First Amendment and condemns actions taken by the previous administration that allegedly infringed on citizens' rights to free speech through coercive measures against social media platforms.\n\nKey findings include:\n\n1. **Restoration of Free Speech**: The order asserts the necessity of protecting the right to free speech without government interference.\n2. **Federal Accountability**: It mandates that no federal employee or resource may be used to infringe upon free speech.\n3. **Investigation of Past Conduct**: The Attorney General is tasked with investigating previous federal actions that contradicted the order\u2019s principles and reporting on remedial actions.\n4. **General Provisions**: The order clarifies that it does not create enforceable rights against the government.\n\nThe implications suggest a significant shift in federal policy toward ensuring free speech is upheld and a commitment to address past government censorship practices."
