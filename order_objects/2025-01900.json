    "title": "Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government",
    "summary": "The document presents Executive Order 14147, issued on January 20, 2025, aimed at ending the weaponization of the federal government against perceived political opponents. It asserts that the previous administration misused federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to target individuals based on political dissent, undermining constitutional rights and the democratic process. The order mandates a comprehensive review by the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence to identify misconduct over the past four years, with recommendations for remedial actions to restore accountability. It emphasizes compliance with document-retention policies and clarifies that the order does not create enforceable rights against the government. The overarching goal is to correct past abuses and ensure that federal powers are not used for political retribution."
